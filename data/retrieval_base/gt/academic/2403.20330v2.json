However, we dig into current evaluation works and identify two primary issues: 1) Visual content is unnecessary for many samples. The answers can be directly inferred from the questions and options, or the world knowledge embedded in LLMs. This phenomenon is prevalent across current benchmarks. For instance, GeminiPro achieves $42.9 \\%$ on the MMMU benchmark without any visual input, and outperforms the random choice baseline across six benchmarks over $24 \\%$ on average. 2) Unintentional data leakage exists in LLM and LVLM training. LLM and LVLM could still answer some visual-necessary questions without visual content, indicating the memorizing of these samples within large-scale training data. For example, Sphinx-X-MoE gets $43.6 \\%$ on MMMU without accessing images, surpassing its LLM backbone with $17.9 \\%$. Both problems lead to misjudgments of actual multi-modal gains and potentially misguide the study of LVLM. To this end, we present MMStar, an elite vision-indispensable multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,500 samples meticulously selected by humans. MMStar benchmarks 6 core capabilities and 18 detailed axes, aiming to evaluate LVLMs' multi-modal capacities with carefully balanced and purified samples. These samples are first roughly selected from current benchmarks with an automated pipeline, human review is then involved to ensure each curated sample exhibits visual dependency, minimal data leakage, and requires advanced multi-modal capabilities. Moreover, two metrics are developed to measure data leakage and actual performance gain in multi-modal training. We evaluate 16 leading LVLMs on MMStar to assess their multi-modal capabilities, and on 7 benchmarks with the proposed metrics to investigate their data leakage and actual multi-modal gain.\n\n\n1 Introduction\n\nEncouraged by the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) [47, 4, 8, 9, 13, 1, 43], integrating visual modality into LLMs to enhance models' interactivity capabilities has witnessed ever-changing advances in recent days [54, 26, 24, 11, 52, 2, 48, 31, 5, 12]. These large visionlanguage models (LVLMs) showcase powerful visual perception and understanding capabilities, enabling them to accept image inputs from users and engage in dialogues, thereby offering a more enriched interactive experience. These achievements have further inspired the research community\n\n\n${ ^{*}$ Equal contribution.

        "text": "Figure 1: We highlight cases in existing multi-modal benchmarks where evaluation samples either lack visual dependency or have unintentionally leaked into the training data of LLMs and LVLMs. (a) Some samples can be answered by LLMs using only text-based world knowledge; (b) For some instances, the question itself contains the answer, making images superfluous; (c) Some samples are leaked into LLMs' training corpora can be \"recalled\" with the textual questions and answers directly; (d) Some samples indiscernible to LLMs but solved by LVLMs without accessing images suggest leakage into LVLMs' multi-modal training data.\nto develop a variety of multi-modal benchmarks $[21,14,27,38,50,51,29,20,30]$, constructed to explore the powerful capabilities emerging from LVLMs and provide a comprehensive and objective platform for quantitatively comparing the continually evolving models. Despite the race among existing evaluation works to construct as many axes as possible to assess the capabilities of LVLMs, we have identified two primary issues upon delving into existing evaluation samples and processes.\n\nFirst, visual content is unnecessary for many samples. A qualified multi-modal evaluation sample should compel LVLMs to understand and reason with the visual content for correct answers. Otherwise, the evaluation sample would degrade into assessing the textual capabilities of LLM bases. Unfortunately, we have identified numerous samples across multiple popular benchmarks [27, 21, 51, 30, 20] where answers can be correctly deduced without relying on visual content. As shown in Figure 1 (a) and (b), some samples have answers directly included within the questions (e.g., What is the shape of the round dirt circle?), while others can be effortlessly answered by leveraging the rich world knowledge embedded within the LLM bases (e.g., What is the capital of Nebraska?). With a comprehensive quantitative analysis of 25 LLMs on 6 benchmarks, we observe this phenomenon is prevalent and serious. For example, more than $50 \\%$ questions of ScienceQA and $20 \\%$ questions of MMMU can be solved by most LLMs directly. For the powerful close source LLM GeminiPro, it achieves $42.9 \\%$ on the MMMU benchmark without any visual input, and outperforms the random choice baseline across six benchmarks by over $24 \\%$ on average.\nTaking aside the inappropriate samples in evaluation, we also observed strange results that LLM and LVLM could still answer some visual-necessary questions without visual content (Figure 1 (c) and (d)). A plausible explanation for this could be the inadvertent memorization of these samples during the large-scale training process, suggesting the presence of unintentional data leakage in the training of LLM and LVLM. Through a detailed study of 22 LVLMs on the 6 benchmarks, we find the unexpected leaking problem during the LVLM training is particularly serious. For example, we find Yi-VL-34B gets $15.0 \\%$ higher performance than its LLM backbone on ScienceQA, Sphinx-X-MoE gets $43.6 \\%$ on MMMU without accessing images, surpassing its LLM backbone with $17.9 \\%$, even surpassing many leading LVLMs with accessing images.\n\nThe existence of inappropriate questions and data leaking would lead to misjudgments of actual multi-modal performance gains and potentially misguide the study of LVLM. In pursuit of a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the MMStar Benchmark. MMStar is a premier, vision-critical multi-modal benchmark that includes 1,500 challenging samples, each rigorously validated by humans. It is structured to test 6 fundamental capabilities and 18 specific di-",

Samples are first roughly selected from current benchmarks with an automated pipeline. In detail, we use eight powerful LLMs as candidates inspectors for visual dependency and LLM leakage, including two closedsource APIs (GPT4-Turbo [34], and GeminiPro [41]) and six leading open-source models (e.g., LLaMA-70B [43], Qwen-1.5-72B [1], and Mixtral-8x7B [19]). Samples that could be answered by more than 2 of the 8 LLMs are excluded as they may exist leaking or visual-unnecessary problems. Then we use 16 leading LVLMs (e.g., GPT4V [35], GeminiPro-Vision [41], LLaVA series [24, 26]) to gauge the difficulty of the samples and split them to four levels. Ultimately, based on the difficulty of the rough-filtered samples, strict manual review and selection are applied to curate 1,500 high-quality multimodal evaluation samples. As shown in Figure 5, these samples span 6 core multimodal capability dimensions and 18 detailed axes, aiming to probe LVLMs' advanced multimodal capabilities with a purified and high-quality set of samples. Moreover, we design the multi-modal gain (MG) and multi-modal leakage (ML) metrics to probe LVLMs' actual performance gain and data leakage degrees derived from multi-modal training in a benchmark-specific manner.\nWe evaluate the accuracy, MG, and ML of 16 leading LVLMs on our MMStar benchmark, the highresolution version of GPT-4V ranks first with $57.1 \\%$ accuracy, showcasing its superb multi-modal capability. GPT-4V also gets the best MG and a small ML, indicating its effective multi-modal training strategy and has less data leaking.\nIn a nutshell, our contributions are threefold:\n- We delve into existing evaluation benchmarks and processes and identify two key issues: (1) Visual content is unnecessary for many samples. (2) Unintentional data leakage exists in LLM and LVLM training. Both lead to misjudgment of LVLM capability and may misguide the following study.\n- We curate MMStar, an elite vision-indispensable multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,500 challenge samples meticulously selected by humans. MMStar covers samples from diverse tasks and difficulties, aiming to evaluate the actual multi-modal capacities of LVLMs.\n- Based on MMStar, we evaluate LVLMs with Accuracy and two newly proposed metrics: multimodal gain and multi-modal leakage. The high-resolution version of GPT-4V outperforms the 16 leading LLMs and ranks first.\n\n\n2 Related Work\n\n\nLarge Vision-Language Models. As large language models (LLMs) [8, 43, 43, 47, 42, 34, 36, 9] rapidly advance, a growing fraction of the research community is focusing on integrating visual content into LLMs to build a powerful intelligent assistant with more interactive ways. Central to these large vision-language models (LVLMs) are the seminal works in modality alignment within the vision-language learning area [37, 17]. The foundation work CLIP [37] exemplifies the alignment of vision and language modalities through contrastive learning on extensive image-text pairs. Built upon the CLIP image encoder which is somewhat aligned with the language modality, current LVLMs typically utilize vast image-text pairs to connect the vision encoder and LLM, enabling LLM to receive and understand visual content [54, 26, 24, 11, 52, 2, 48, 31, 5]. For example, MiniGPT4 [54] and LLaVA [26] directly connect the vision encoder and LLM with QFormer [22] and MLP [40], showing proficiency in multi-modal dialogues. Subsequent works have further enhanced LVLMs by improving the multi-modal instruction data [24, 48, 5, 44] and designing novel modules $[2,23,45,28,15,12]$ for more sufficient modality alignment.\nEvaluations of LVLMs. To probe the true capabilities of the emerging LVLMs, the research community has developed many multi-modal benchmarks encompassing a wide range of evaluation axes [27, 14, 38, 51, 39, 21, 26, 50, 46]. Early single-task benchmarks, such as VQA [16], MS-COCO [39], and OK-VQA [38], fail to holistically assess LVLMs' general multi-modal perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, comprehensive multi-modal benchmarks have been constructed [26, 21, 51, 14, 27, 7, 46]. For example, SEED [21] and MMBench [27] cover 12 and 20 evaluation dimensions respectively, while MMMU [51] spans 30 college-level subjects, providing some competitive arenas for a comprehensive comparison of cutting-edge LVLMs. However, existing evaluations of LVLMs overlook some critical issues. On the one hand, they do not guar-",

On the other hand, current evaluations consistently adhere to the process of inferring on given benchmarks and calculating scores for LVLMs, overlooking the possibility of data leakage during multi-modal training. This oversight can lead to unfair comparisons and misjudgments of the real gains in multimodal capabilities brought by multi-modal training.\n\n\n3 Two Overlooked Issues for Evaluating LVLMs\n\n\nIn this section, we delve into two commonly overlooked issues in current LVLM evaluation works. Moreover, we present detailed experimental results to further substantiate our observations.\n\nFirst issue: visual content is unnecessary for many evaluation samples. The key distinction between evaluating LLMs and LVLMs lies in the necessity for LVLM evaluations to strictly ensure that the correct answers can only be derived based on a thorough understanding of visual content. Without this, evaluating LVLMs' multi-modal capabilities degrades to merely assessing their LLM backbones' uni-modal abilities. However, upon examining samples from some popular LVLM benchmarks, we find many samples lack vital visual dependency and can yield correct answers even without the image inputs! Through analysis of these failure samples, we categorize them into two groups: (1) Answers can be directly obtained from the world knowledge embedded in LLMs, owing to the LLMs' extensive pertaining on the large corpus of data. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1(a), the question \"What is the capital of Nebraska?\" already provides the key information \"Nebraska\", eliminating the need for extracting relevant location information from visual content. A more appropriate question is \"What is the capital of the highlighted area in the image?\" to emphasize",

Specifically, we evaluate several benchmarks with two closed-source LLMs (GPT4Turbo [34], and GeminiPro [41]) and six opensource heavy LLMs (InternLM2-20B [42], Yi34B [49], Mixtral-8x7B [19], Deepseek-67B [3], LLaMA2-70B [43], and Qwen1.5-72B [1]), recording the hit count for each question.

As depicted in Figure 2, every benchmark shows a certain degree of samples that visual contents are unnecessary, with ScienceQA [30] and AI2D [20] exhibiting amazing abnormal hit rates of $57.2 \\%$ and $46.2 \\%$, respectively.

Although the community has the trend towards developing new multi-modal benchmarks to assess LVLMs' capabilities from various dimensions, there is scant consideration for fairness and reliability during evaluation. Training LLMs and LVLMs requires vast and diverse data, inevitably leading to the leakage of evaluation samples. Such incidents are usually unintended, as it's impractical to predict which data will be used in future evaluation benchmarks during the preparation for training corpus.\n\nFigure 1 (c) showcases an evaluation sample leaked by LLMs. Though the question requires an understanding of image content, 16 out of 22 tested LLMs astonishingly provide the correct response by \"recalling\" their training data. To quantitatively support our observations, we evaluate 22 leading LLMs across 6 popular benchmarks and report the 0 -shot results in Table 1 and 2 -shot results in Table 2. Specifically, we find the 2 -shot evaluation strategy is more stable than the 0 -shot to reduce refusal for answering and align answer formats. Under the impact of vision-independent samples and data leakage from LLMs, GeminiPro [41] and Qwen1.5-72B [1] achieve a remarkable average accuracy of $41.4 \\%$ and $43.6 \\%$ under the 2 -shot setting, outperforming random choice by $20.4 \\%$ and $22.6 \\%$, respectively. Furthermore, Qwen1.5-72B achieves a score of $42.4 \\%$ on MMMU [51], even surpassing the performance of the majority of LVLMs with accessing images. This result serves as a reminder: if we only consider the final accuracy on benchmarks when evaluating LVLMs, potential data leakage from LLMs could lead to unfair comparisons.",

We showcase samples that LLMs cannot answer correctly but LVLMs without accessing images (LVLM-text) can. Each LLMLVLM ${ }^{\\text {text }}$ pair represents an LLM and its corresponding LVLM without accessing images, totaling 16 pairs. The chart in the center tallies the number of samples in existing benchmarks hit by more than half of the LLMLVLM $^{\\text {text }}$ pairs, underscoring the issue of data leakage during the multi-modal training process.\n\nIn Figure 1 (d) and Figure 3, we showcase some examples where original LLMs fail, but LVLMs without accessing images succeed. Despite these questions requiring image content for accurate answers, the LVLMs without accessing images are capable of correctly answering these questions which stump original LLMs. To further support our hypotheses of data leakage during LVLMs’ multi-modal training, we conduct an intriguing experiment. We remove the image inputs for LVLMs and only utilize textual questions and options for evaluation, with the results reported in Table 3. We compare the performance gains of LVLMs set to receive only text inputs (LVLM-text) against their corresponding LLM bases (LLM) to quantitatively assess the degree of data leakage in LVLMs' multi-modal training. As shown in Table 3, most LVLMs exhibit varying degrees of data leakage during multi-modal training. For example, the LLMs of Sphinx-X-8x7B [15] and Monkey-Chat [23], show a respective average performance gain of $14.1 \\%$ and $14.2 \\%$ compared to their original LLMs.\nDrawing from our observations, we posit that the issue of data leakage in multi-modal datasets is a significant concern that warrants attention. For research to be transparent and equitable, it is imperative to account for and mitigate such leakage. This will ensure that the performance of models is evaluated on their true ability to integrate and interpret multi-modal data, rather than their capacity to memorize specific samples. A proper benchmark would be a crucial step toward advancing the field of multi-modal language model research.\n\n\n4 MMStar\n\n\nWith the aforementioned analysis, we present an elite vision-dependent multi-modal benchmark, dubbed as MMStar.

After applying the coarse filter process and manual review, we narrow down from a total of 22,401 samples to 11,607 candidate samples and finally select 1,500 high-quality samples to construct our MMStar benchmark.\n4.2 provides a detailed analysis of the constructed MMStar benchmark. In Section 4.3, we introduce two benchmark-specific metrics developed to evaluate the degree of data leakage as well as the actual performance gains in multimodal capabilities from the multi-modal training.\n\n\n4.1 Data Curation Process\n\n\nCriteria for data curation. The evaluation samples for constructing the MMStar benchmark should meet three fundamental criteria: 1) Visual dependency. The collected samples can be correctly answered only based on understanding the visual content; 2) Minimal data leakage. The collected samples should minimize the risk of unintentional inclusion in LLMs' training corpus, or be effectively transformed from uni-modal to multi-modal formats to prevent LLMs from \"recalling\" the correct answers; 3) Requiring advanced multi-modal capabilities for resolution. In addition to ensuring fairness and reliability by adhering to the above criteria, we also aim for samples to cover various difficulty levels. We expect to comprehensively capture LVLMs' multi-modal capabilities with succinct high-quality samples.\nData filter. We first choose two benchmarks [27, 21] focused on natural images and four centered on scientific and technical knowledge [51, 30, 20, 29] for our sample collection. We then develop an automated pipeline to preliminarily filter out samples that do not meet the first two criteria. Specifically, we employ two closed-source LLMs [41, 34] and six open-source LLMs [1, 42, 49, 3, 19, 43] sizing 20B or larger to serve as inspectors. These open-source LLMs are applied with a 2-shot in-context inference strategy to minimize response refusals and ensure consistency in answer formatting. Following this, we evaluate the sample pool with these LLM inspectors, documenting the hit frequency for each evaluation sample. Finally, we only retain those samples with hit counts of two or fewer hits, indicating that around $75 \\%$ of LLM inspectors fail to provide the correct answer. As illustrated in Figure 4, following this initial coarse filtering, our sample pool was reduced from 22,401 to 11,607 .\nManual review. After the coarse filtering with LLM inspectors, we further employ three experts to conduct the manual review process to ensure: 1) each sample's answer should be based on the understanding of visual content; 2) selected samples should cover a comprehensive range of capability assessment dimensions; 3) most samples should require LVLMs to possess advanced multi-modal abilities for resolution. To expedite the manual selection of samples with varying difficulty levels for LVLMs, we tally the hit counts of all 16 LVLMs on the coarsely filtered samples and split them into four difficulty categories: easy (12-16), moderate (8-11), hard (4-7), and tough ( 0 -3). Finally, after considering both the diversity of capability dimensions and difficulty levels, we manually curated $\\mathbf{1 , 5 0 0}$ high-quality samples from the coarsely filtered set. Figure 4 showcases the detailed composition of data sources for our final selection of samples.\n\n4.2 Core Capabilities\n\nWe select and consolidate the dimensions used for assessing LVLMs' multi-modal capabilities in existing benchmarks and identify six core capability dimensions along with eighteen detailed axes.",

In MMStar, we display 6 core capabilities in the inner ring, with 18 detailed axes presented in the outer ring. The middle ring showcases the number of samples for each detailed dimension. Each core capability contains a meticulously balanced 250 samples. We further ensure a relatively even distribution across the 18 detailed axes.\n\nIn Figure 5, we provide statistics for each core capability and their detailed axes on the MMStar benchmark.\n\nCoarse Perception (CP). This core dimension refers to the capability to understand and interpret the overarching characteristics and themes of an image without delving into the finer details. It encompasses a broad, holistic view of the visual content, enabling the identification of: 1) image style \\& quality; 2) image scene \\& topic; and 3) image emotion.\n\nFine-grained Perception (FP). This core dimension represents a sophisticated level of image understanding that focuses on the detailed and nuanced aspects of visual content. It involves a deep dive into the specifics of images: 1) attribute \\& celebrity recognition; 2) object location; and 3) object counting. This core dimension unveils the subtle intricacies that coarse perception might overlook.\nInstance Reasoning (IR). It encapsulates a set of advanced cognitive capabilities focused on understanding and interpreting individual and collective object attributes and interrelations within an image. This process goes beyond mere recognition, delving into the analytical assessment of: 1) single-instance attribute reasoning; 2) cross-instance attribute comparison; and 3) cross-instance relation reasoning. It is a critical component for systems requiring a deep semantic understanding of visual content, enabling nuanced interaction with and response to complex visual content.\nLogical Reasoning (LR). This core dimension encompasses a sophisticated framework of cognitive processes designed to interpret, deduce, and infer conclusions from visual content through a structured approach to logic and reasoning. This multi-faceted capability marries the intuitive understanding of visual content with the structured rigor of logical deduction, enabling: 1) diagram reasoning; 2) code \\& sequence reasoning; and 3) common reasoning.\nScience \\& Technology (ST). It consists of a comprehensive framework for the application and integration of knowledge across a broad spectrum of science and technology.

Therefore, we propose two novel metrics to separately assess the degree of data leakage and actual performance gain from the multi-modal training process.\nTo calculate the multi-modal gain (MG) metric for a given LVLM on a particular benchmark, we need to compute the scores of the same LVLM with and without visual inputs, separately denoted as $S_{v}$ and $S_{w v}$. Then the MG metric can be derived from the following formulation:\n$$M G=S_{v}-S_{w v}$$\n\nTo calculate the multi-modal leakage (ML) metric, we need to compute the extra score of the given LVLM's LLM base (without any multi-modal training), denoted as $S_{t}$. Then the ML metric is formulated as follows:\n$$M L=\\max \\left(0, S_{w v}-S_{t}\\right)$$\n\n5 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we conduct a systematic analysis of the proposed MMStar benchmark along with the MG/ML metrics. We detail the experimental setup in Section 5.1, study and analyze the performance of 16 leading LVLMs on MMStar in Section 5.2, and extensively investigate the MG/ML metrics of 16 LVLMs across 6 popular benchmarks and our MMStar in Section 5.3.\n\n5.1 Experimental Setups\n\nEvaluation models. 1) Baselines: We utilize random choice and frequent choice strategies to serve as the baselines. The former randomly selects an option as the answer, while the latter selects the most frequent option within each benchmark dimension. 2) Large Language Models: We prepare two closed-source LLMs, GPT4 [34] and GeminiPro [41], and 20 popular open-source LLMs sizing from 1.8B to 72B for text-only evaluation, such as Qwen series [1], LLaMA2 series [43], Phi2 [32], Vicuna series [8], Deepseek series [3], InternLM2 series [42], Baichuan2 series [47], Yi series [49], Mistral series [18, 19]. Additionally, all the open-source LLMs we used are their Chat versions. and 3) Large Vision-Language Models: We prepare two closed-source LVLMs, GPT4V [35] and GeminiPro-Vision [41], and 14 popular open-source LVLMs sizing from 3B to 60B, such as TinyLLaVA-3B [53], Yi-VL series [49], Qwen-VL-Chat [2], LLaVA-1.5 series [24], ShareGPT4V-7B [5], Monkey-Chat [23], LLaVA-Next [25], Deepseek-VL-7B [28], LLaVA-Next34B [25], CogVLM-Chat-17B [45], InternVL-Chat-v1.2 [6], Sphinx-X-8x7B [15].\nImplementation details. For evaluating LLMs on existing benchmarks, we employ both 0 -shot and 2 -shot strategies and will specify which is utilized when reporting results. For evaluating LLMs on MMStar, the 0 -shot strategy yields poor scores, making comparisons difficult. Therefore, we exclusively utilize the 2 -shot strategy to decrease the frequency of refusal to answer. Moreover, All LVLMs are evaluated utilizing the 0 -shot strategy across all benchmarks to ensure a fair comparison. When evaluating LVLMs under the 'LVLM-text' setting (i.e. answer without the image), most LVLMs work well by simply removing the image tokens from their default input tokens.However, GeminiPro-Vision [41] and CogVLM-Chat [45] require the replacement of the original images with pure grey images to bypass image content input and operate correctly. Given that all questions are ensured to be converted into a multiple-choice format, we develop some heuristic matching rules to calculate accuracy, avoiding the cumbersome process of re-invoking GPT4 for answer extraction. Moreover, all experiments in this study are conducted within the same codebase modified from VLMEvalKit [10], and utilize NVIDIA A100 GPUs for non-API-based evaluation.",

Encouragingly, the performance of these LLMs is almost indistinguishable from random choice, effectively validating that the evaluation samples of our MMStar exhibit significant visual dependency and minimal data leakage from LLMs. Notably, the smallest model, Qwen1.5-1.8B, achieves the best score. We conjecture this is due to it suffering the least stringent safety restrictions, thereby reducing instances of refusal to answer.

Among the open-source LVLMs, InternLMXcomposer2 [12] achieves an impressive score of 55.4\\%. LLaVA-Next [25] even surpasses GPT4V and GeminiPro-Vision [41] in the mathematics (MA) core capability. Notably, no LVLMs managed to reach a passing average score (i.e. $60 \\%$ ) in the core capabilities of fine-grained perception (FP), logical reasoning (LR), science \\& Technology (ST), and mathematics (MA), highlighting these dimensions as particularly challenging for existing LVLMs. Moreover, TinyLLaVA [53], despite its modest 3B scale, outperformed some competitors of 7B and even 13B surprisingly, underscoring the potential of smaller-scale LVLMs. Additionally, even with the same architecture, ShareGPT4V7B [5] even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-13B with high-quality caption data. This result highlights the significance of high-quality caption data for LVLM performance to the community.\n\n\n5.3 Results Analysis of MG/ML\n\n\nIn this section, we present the results of our proposed multi-modal gain (MG) and multi-modal leakage (ML) metrics of 16 LVLMs with varying sizes and architectures on 6 popular benchmarks and our MMStar benchmark. We then detail our observations and analyses from both the model and benchmark perspectives.\n\nAnalysis from the model perspective. In Table 6, we illustrate the MG/ML (Multi-modal Gain/Multi-modal Leakage) metrics for each LVLM across each benchmark and provide an average MG/ML metric across all benchmarks in the final column. For closed-source LVLMs, GPT4V demonstrates notable performance gains attributed to its multi-modal training, while GeminiProVision shows lesser data leakage during multi-modal training. This suggests that GPT4V may have utilized a broader range of multi-modal training data compared to GeminiPro-Vision. Among the open-source LVLMs, InternLM-XComposer2 achieves the highest average multi-modal gain of 28.1 across all benchmarks, whereas LLaVA-1.5-7B records the lowest at 14.8.

Additionally, models like Monkey-Chat, Spinx-X-MoE, and Deepspeek-VL display higher degrees of multi-modal leakage, highlighting the need for the community to consider this factor for fair comparisons.\nAnalysis from the benchmark perspective. In the final row of Table 6, we list the average multimodal gain and multi-modal leakage for existing LVLMs across all benchmarks for analysis. MMBench registers the highest average multi-modal gain at 50.1 , indicating a significant overlap between the domains covered by existing LVLMs' training data and MMBench. Conversely, MMMU exhibits the lowest average multi-modal gain at 5.8, suggesting a lesser degree of overlap between the domains of existing LVLMs' training corpora and those included in MMMU. Additionally, MMStar, as expected, has the lowest degree of multi-modal leakage at 1.9. This provides a comprehensive and fair arena for comparing existing LVLMs. Moreover, we believe evaluating existing LVLMs to derive average ML metrics can also be helpful to the following works in examining newly developed multi-modal benchmarks.\n\n\n6 Conclusion\n\n\nIn this work, we dig into current evaluation works for large vision-language models (LVLMs) and identify two primary issues: 1) visual content is unnecessary for many samples, and 2) unintentional data leakage exists in LLM and LVLM training. To address these issues, we develop an elite vision-dependent multi-modal benchmark named MMStar and propose two metrics to measure the data leakage and actual performance gain in LVLMs' multi-modal training. MMStar undergoes the manual review of each sample, covering 6 core capabilities and 18 detailed axes for an in-depth evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal capabilities. In our evaluation of 16 diverse LVLMs on MMStar, even the best model scores under 60 on average. We also analyze the MG and ML metrics across 6 multimodal benchmarks and MMStar, providing valuable insights for the community on gathering multimodal training data and crafting new benchmarks. In the future, we plan to expand MMStar into a larger, online test set and explore dynamic evaluation methods to maintain sample visual dependency and reduce accidental data leakage into LLM's and LVLM's training corpora.",
