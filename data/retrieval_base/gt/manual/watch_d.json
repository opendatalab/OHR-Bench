Blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day.\nTo correctly manage blood pressure, it is recommended that you measure your blood pressure at the same time every day.\n- Blood pressure fluctuates in the following situations:\n- Within 1 hour after meal\n- After going to the toilet\n- After drinking alcohol and caffeine\n- Not being quiet during the measurement\n- After smoking\n- Feeling stressed\n- After bathing\n- The environment being too cold or hot, or changing drastically\n- After exercise\n- Measurement results can be affected if long-time measurements cause blood stasis. During the measurement, the wrist is pressed by the airbag, which may result in the blood flow to your fingertips slowing down and cause blood stasis. In this case, take off your watch, raise your arm high, and repeatedly make a fist and open it for about 15 times.\n\nThe blood pressure measured at home is different from that measured at the hospital\n- If the blood pressure measured at home is lower than that measured at the hospital, the possible causes are as follows:\n- You feel more stressed at the hospital, resulting in the blood pressure higher than it should be.\nYou have greater peace of mind and your body is more relaxed at home, sometimes resulting in the blood pressure lower than that measured at the hospital.\n- The measurement results will be lower if the measurement position is above the heart.\nThe measurement results may be lower if your wrist is above your heart during the measurement.\n- If the blood pressure measured at home is higher than that measured at the hospital, the possible causes are as follows:"

Then, your blood pressure will rise. Consult a doctor for details.\n- The measured values may also be higher when the watch isn't worn tight. If the watch is too loose on your wrist, the pressure cannot reach the blood vessels, resulting in the measurement results being higher than expected.\n- An incorrect measurement posture may also result in higher measurement results. Higher measurement results may also result from sitting cross-legged, on a low sofa or in front of a low table, or other postures exerting pressure on your abdomen, or placing the watch below the heart.\n\n\nMeasuring blood pressure\n\n\nThe blood pressure measurement feature helps you better manage your health.\n(i) This product can be used as a reference in clinical practice, but the measurement results cannot serve as the basis for diagnosis.\n- If you feel uncomfortable during a measurement due to the airbag inflating excessively or other reasons, stop the measurement immediately to deflate the airbag or unfasten the strap.\n- To prevent injuring your arm, do not keep your arm in the device for a long time when it is inflated.\n\nPrecautions\n- If you feel uncomfortable during a measurement due to the airbag inflating excessively or other reasons, stop the measurement immediately to deflate the airbag or unfasten the strap.\n- Unfasten your strap if the inflation pressure increases to more than 300 mmHg ( 40 kPa ) but does not deflate automatically.\n- To ensure the accuracy of measurement results, comply with the following requirements:\n- The airbag and strap sizes are suitable, you are wearing the device correctly, and your posture during the measurement is correct. For details, see the Wearing Guide.\n- Measure your blood pressure during the same time period each day. Measurement results may vary depending on the time of day.\n- After smoking, drinking alcohol, coffee, or black tea, bathing, or doing exercise, wait at least 30 minutes before measuring.\n- After going to the toilet, wait 10 minutes before measuring.\n- Do not measure within one hour after eating a meal.\n- Do not measure in a place where the temperature is too low or too high or the environment changes dramatically."
