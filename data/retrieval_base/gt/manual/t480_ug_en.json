        "text": "Power adapters\n\n\n$\\triangle$ DANGER\n\nUse only the power adapters supplied by the product manufacturer.\nNever wrap a power adapter cable around a power adapter or other object. Doing so can stress the cord in ways that can cause the power adapter cable to fray, crack, or crimp. This can present a safety hazard.\n\nAlways route the power adapter cable so that they will not be walked on, tripped over, or pinched by objects.\n\nProtect power adapters from liquids. For instance, do not leave your power adapter near sinks, tubs, toilets, or on floors that are cleaned with liquid cleansers. Liquids can cause a short circuit, particularly if the power adapter has been stressed by misuse. Liquids also can cause gradual corrosion of the connector terminals on a power adapter, which can eventually result in overheating.\n\nEnsure that all power adapter connectors are securely and completely plugged into receptacles.\nDo not use any power adapter that shows corrosion at the ac input pins or shows signs of overheating (such as deformed plastic) at the ac input pins or anywhere on the power adapter.\n\nTo prevent possible overheating, do not cover the power adapter with clothing or other objects when the power adapter is plugged into an electrical outlet.\n\nExtension cords and related devices\n\nEnsure that extension cords, surge protectors, uninterruptible power supplies, and power strips that you use are rated to handle the electrical requirements of the product. Never overload these devices. If power strips are used, the load should not exceed the power strip input rating.

Different computer components consume power at different rates. The more you use the power-intensive components, the faster you consume battery power.\n\nSpend more time unplugged with ThinkPad batteries. Mobility has revolutionized business by enabling you to take your work wherever you go. With ThinkPad batteries, you are able to work longer without being tied to an electrical outlet.\n\nChecking the battery status\n\nMove your pointer to the battery-status icon in the Windows notification area to check the battery status. The battery-status icon displays the percentage of battery power remaining and how long you can use your computer before you must charge the battery.\n\nThe rate at which you use battery power determines how long you can use the battery of your computer between charges. Because every computer user has individual habits and needs, it is difficult to predict how long a battery charge lasts. There are two main factors:\n- How much energy is stored in the battery when you begin to work\n- The way you use your computer, for example:\n- How often you access the storage drive\n- How bright you make the computer display\n- How often you use the wireless feature\n\nCharging the battery\n\nWhen you find that the remaining battery power is low, charge your battery or replace the battery with a charged battery.\n\nIf an ac outlet is convenient, connect the computer to ac power. The battery is fully charged in about four to eight hours. The actual charging time depends on the battery size, the physical environment, and whether you are using the computer. You can check the battery charging status at any time through the batterystatus icon in the Windows notification area.\n\nNote: To maximize the life of the battery, the computer does not start recharging the battery if the remaining power is greater than $95 \\%$.\n\nWhen to charge the battery\n- Battery charging is affected by its temperature.

Security\n\n\nThis chapter provides information about how to protect your computer from unauthorized use.\n\nUsing passwords\n\nThis topic provides information about how to use the power-on password, supervisor password, and hard disk password.\n\nPasswords introduction\n\nYou can help prevent your computer from unauthorized use by using passwords. After you set a password, a prompt is displayed on the screen each time you turn on the computer. Enter your password at the prompt. You cannot use the computer unless you type the correct password.\n\nIf you have set a power-on password, a supervisor password, or a hard disk password, it unlocks automatically when the computer resumes from sleep mode.\n\nNote: If a Windows password has been set, you are prompted to enter it when the computer resumes from sleep mode.\n\nPower-on password\n\nYou can set a power-on password to help protect your computer against unauthorized access.\nIf you set a power-on password, the password prompt is displayed on the screen whenever you turn on the computer. You must enter the correct password to start using the computer.\n\nWhen this icon 回旺 is displayed, type a power-on password or a supervisor password.\n\nSupervisor password\n\nThe supervisor password protects the system information stored in the ThinkPad Setup program. It provides the following security features:\n- If only a supervisor password is set, a password prompt is displayed when you try to start the ThinkPad Setup program. Unauthorized users cannot change most of the system configuration options in the ThinkPad Setup program without the password.\n- The system administrator can use the supervisor password to access a computer even if the user of that computer has set a power-on password. The supervisor password overrides the power-on password.\n- The system administrator can set the same supervisor password on many ThinkPad notebook computers to make administration easier.\n\nHard disk passwords\n\nSetting a hard disk password prevents unauthorized access to the data on the hard disk drive. When a hard disk password is set, you are prompted to type a valid password each time you try to access the hard disk drive.\n\nThe following two types of hard disk passwords can help protect the information stored on the storage drive:\n\n- User hard disk password",

The master hard disk password is set and used by a system administrator. It enables the administrator to access any storage drive in a system like a master key. The administrator sets the master password; then assign a user password for each computer in the network. The user can then change the user password as desired, but the administrator still can get access by using the master password.\nWhen a master hard disk password is set, only the administrator can remove the user hard disk password.\nWhen this icon is displayed, type a user hard disk password. To type a master hard disk passord, press F1. When the icon changes to 量, type the master hard disk password. To return to the icon , press F1 again.\n\nTips on using the hard disk passwords:\n- You can set the minimum length of a hard disk password.\n- If you set a hard disk password of over seven characters, the storage drive can be used only with a computer that can recognize a hard disk password of over seven characters. If you then install the storage drive in a computer that cannot recognize a hard disk password that contains more than seven characters, you cannot access the drive.\n- Record your password and store it in a safe place. If you forget the user hard disk password, or both user and master hard disk passwords, Lenovo cannot reset your passwords or recover data from the storage drive. You must take your computer to a Lenovo reseller or a marketing representative to have the storage drive replaced. Proof of purchase is required, and a fee will be charged for parts and service.\nNotes: The eDrive storage drives or Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Opal-compliant storage drives provide self-encryption capabilities to secure your data.\n- If a TCG Opal-compliant storage drive and a TCG Opal management software program are installed, and the TCG Opal management software program is activated, the hard disk password is not available.\n- If an eDrive storage drive is installed in your computer, and your computer is preinstalled with the Windows 10 operating system, the hard disk password is not available.\n\nSetting, changing, or removing a password\n\nBefore you start, print these instructions.\nTo set, change, or remove a password, do the following:\n1. Restart the computer. When the logo screen is displayed, press F1 to start the ThinkPad Setup program.\n2. Select Security $\\rightarrow$ Password by using the directional keys.\n3. Depending on the password type, select Power-on Password, Supervisor Password, or Hard disk x Password.\n4. Follow the instructions on the screen to set, change, or remove a password.\n\nYou might want to record your password and store it in a safe place. Otherwise, if you forget the password, you have to take your computer to a Lenovo reseller or a marketing representative to have the password canceled.",

For security, a longer password is recommended.\n- The hard disk drive built into your computer can be protected by UEFI BIOS. To provide reliable security, use the security chip and a security program with the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) management feature. See \"Setting the security chip\" on page 55.\n- If a Disk Encryption storage drive is installed in your computer, ensure to protect the contents of your computer from unauthorized access by use of drive encryption software, such as Microsoft Windows BitLocker ${ }^{\\circledR}$ Drive Encryption.\n- Before you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer, delete the data stored on it. For more information, see \"Deleting data from your storage drive\" on page 58.\n\nUsing Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption\n\nTo help protect your computer against unauthorized access, use the drive encryption software, such as Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\nWindows BitLocker Drive Encryption (referred to as BitLocker) is an integral security feature of some editions of the Windows operating system. It can help you protect the operating system and data stored on your computer, even if your computer is lost or stolen. BitLocker can encrypt all user and system files, including the swap and hibernation files.\n\nBitLocker uses the TPM to provide enhanced protection for your data and to ensure early boot component integrity. A compatible TPM is defined as a V2.0 TPM.\n\nTo check the BitLocker status, go to Control Panel, view Control Panel by Category, and click System and Security $\\rightarrow$ BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\nFor more information, see the help system of the Windows operating system, or search for \"Microsoft Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption Step-by-Step Guide\" on the Microsoft Web site.\n\nDisk Encryption hard disk drive and Encryption solid-state drive\n\nSome models contain the Disk Encryption hard disk drive, Encryption solid-state drive, or Encryption hybrid drive. This encryption technology helps to protect your computer against security attacks on media, NAND flash, or device controllers by use of a hardware encryption chip. For the efficient use of the encryption feature, set a hard disk password for the internal storage drive.\n\nSetting the security chip\n\nStrict security requirements are imposed on network client computers that transfer confidential information electronically. Depending on the options you ordered, your computer might have an embedded security chip (a cryptographic microprocessor). With the security chip, you can do the following:\n- Protect your data and system\n- Strengthen access controls\n- Secure communications\n\nBefore you start, print these instructions.\nTo set an item on the Security Chip submenu, do the following:",

Otherwise anyone can change the settings for the security chip.\n- When you clear the security chip, turn off your computer and then turn it on again after you set the security chip to Active. Otherwise, the Clear Security Chip option is not displayed.\n\nUsing the fingerprint reader\nDepending on the model, your computer might have a fingerprint reader. Fingerprint authentication can replace your passwords, such as the Windows password, power-on password, and hard disk password. In this way, you can log in to your computer simply and securely.\n\nEnrolling your fingerprints\nTo enable fingerprint authentication, enroll your fingerprints first. During the enrollment, the fingerprints are associated with the Windows password automatically. It is recommended that you enroll more than one fingerprint in case of any injuries to your fingers.\n\nTo enroll your fingerprints, do the following:\n1. Open the Start menu and then click Settings $\\rightarrow$ Accounts $\\rightarrow$ Sign-in options.\n2. Follow the instructions on the screen to finish the enrollment.\n\nScanning your finger\nTo scan your finger, tap the fingerprint reader with the top joint of your finger and hold your finger there for one or two seconds with a little pressure.

        "text": "If your finger has any of the following conditions, you might not be able to register or authenticate it:\n- Your finger is wrinkled.\n- Your finger is rough, dry, or injured.\n- Your finger is stained with dirt, mud, or oil.\n- The surface of your finger is different from the one when you enrolled your fingerprint.\n- Your finger is wet.\n- Your finger that you are currently using has not been enrolled before.\n\nTo improve the situation, try the following:\n- Clean or wipe your hands to remove any excess dirt or moisture from the fingers.\n- Enroll and use a different finger for authentication.\n\n\nDeleting data from your storage drive\n\n\nSome of the data stored on the storage drive might be sensitive. Handing your computer over to someone else without deleting the installed software, such as operating systems and programs, might even violate the license agreements. Be sure to delete data stored on the storage drive before you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer.\n\nYou can use the following methods to delete data from the storage drive:\n- Move the data to the Recycle Bin, and then empty the Recycle Bin.\n- Format your storage drive, using the software to initialize it.\n- Use the recovery program provided by Lenovo to bring the storage drive back to the factory default settings.\n\nThese operations, however, only change the file location of the data; they do not delete the data itself. The data is still there, even though it seems to be lost. Thus, it is sometimes possible to read the data by use of special software for data recovery. There is a risk that people of bad faith might read and misuse the critical data on storage drives for unexpected purposes.\n\nTo prevent leakage of data, it is important that you delete all the data from the hard disk drive when you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer. You can destroy the data physically by smashing the hard disk drive with a hammer, or magnetically by means of strong magnetic power, thus making the data unreadable. But it is recommended that you use the software (payware) or service (pay service) developed for that purpose. The process might take several hours.\n\nFor disposing of data on the solid-state drive, Lenovo provides the Drive Erase Utility for Resetting the Cryptographic Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool.\n\nSome computers might support a Disk Encryption hard disk drive or Encryption solid-state drive and have such a drive installed. You can logically dispose of all the data on the drive in a short time by erasing the cryptographic key. The data encrypted with the old key is not physically erased but remains on the drive; however, it cannot be decrypted without the old key. This feature is also available with the Drive Erase Utility for Resetting the Cryptographic Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool.\n\nUsing firewalls\n\nIf your system is preinstalled with a firewall program, it protects against computer Internet security threats, unauthorized access, intrusions, and Internet attacks. It also protects your privacy.",

Each hardware component on your computer has its own specific driver. If you add a component, the operating system must be instructed on how to operate that piece of hardware. After you install the driver, the operating system can recognize the hardware component and understand how to use it.\n\nNote: Because drivers are programs, like any other file on your computer, they are susceptible to corruption and might not perform properly if corruption occurs.\n\nIt is not always necessary to download the latest drivers. However, you should download the latest driver for a component when you notice poor performance from that component or when you added a component. This action might eliminate the driver as the potential cause of a problem.\n\nGetting the latest drivers from the Web site\n\nYou can download and install updated device drivers from the Lenovo Support Web site by doing the following:\n1. Go to https://support.lenovo.com.\n2. Select the entry for your computer and then follow the instructions on the screen to download and install necessary software.\n\nGetting the latest drivers using Lenovo Vantage\n\nThe system update function of Lenovo Vantage helps you keep the software on your computer up-to-date. Update packages are stored on Lenovo servers and can be downloaded from the Lenovo Support Web site. Update packages can contain applications, device drivers, UEFI BIOS flashes, or software updates. When Lenovo Vantage connects to the Lenovo Support Web site, the program automatically recognizes the following information and determines what updates are available for your computer:\n- Machine type and model of your computer\n- Installed operating system\n- Language of the operating system\n\nLenovo Vantage then displays a list of update packages and categorizes each update as critical, recommended, or optional to help you understand the importance. You have complete control of which updates to download and install. After you select the update packages you want, Lenovo Vantage automatically downloads and installs the updates.",

        "text": "Chapter 7. Troubleshooting computer problems\n\n\nThis chapter provides information about what to do if you experience a problem with your computer.\n\nGeneral tips for preventing problems\n\nThis topic provides the following tips to help you prevent computing problems:\n- Empty your recycle bin on a regular basis.\n- Use a disk defragment tool regularly on your storage drive to improve data seek and read times.\n- To free up disk space, uninstall unused programs. You also might want to look for program duplication or overlapping versions.\n- Clean out your Inbox, Sent, and Trash folders from your e-mail client program.\n- Back up your data at least once a week. If critical data is present, it is a good idea to back up the data daily. Lenovo has many backup options available for your computer.\n- Schedule system restore operations to take a system snapshot periodically. For information about system restore, see Chapter 8 \"Recovery information\" on page 97.\n- Go to https://support.lenovo.com to download and install updates for the device drivers and UEFI BIOS when needed.\n- Keep up to date for device drivers on other non-Lenovo hardware. Before updating device drivers, read the device driver information release notes for compatibility or known issues.\n- Keep a log book. Entries might include major hardware or software changes, driver updates, minor issues you have experienced, and how you resolved the minor issues.\n- If you ever need to run a recovery on your computer to return the preinstalled contents onto the machine, the following tips might help along the way:\n1. Remove all external devices such as the printer and keyboard.\n2. Ensure that your battery is charged and your computer has the ac power connected.\n3. Access ThinkPad Setup and load the default settings.\n4. Restart the computer and start the recovery operation.\n5. If your computer uses discs as the recovery media, do not remove the disc from the drive until prompted to do so.\n\nDiagnosing problems\n\nMany computer problems can be solved without outside assistance. If you experience a problem with your computer, the first place to start is the troubleshooting information in your computer documentation. If you suspect a software problem, see the documentation, including readme files and help information systems, that come with the operating system or program. ThinkPad notebook computers come with a set of diagnostic programs that you can use to help you identify hardware problems.\n\nNote: If you are unable to isolate and repair the problem yourself after running Lenovo Vantage, save and print the log files created by the program. You need the log files when you speak to a Lenovo technical support representative.\n\nLenovo Vantage supports the hardware scan function. It combines diagnostic tests, system information collection, security status, and support information, along with hints and tips for optimal system performance. To run Lenovo Vantage, see \"Accessing Lenovo programs\" on page 14.",

Press and hold the power button until the computer turns off. If you cannot turn off the computer by pressing the power button, remove the ac power adapter and the removable battery. After the computer is turned off, reconnect the ac power adapter and reinstall the removable battery, and then restart the computer by pressing the power button. If the computer does not turn on, continue with step 2.\n2. While the computer is turned off, remove all power sources from the computer (removable battery and the ac power adapter). Plug in the ac power adapter while keeping the removable battery out of the computer. If the computer does not turn back on, continue with step 3.\n\nNote: When the computer starts up and enters the Windows environment, use the proper shutdown procedure to turn off the computer. When the computer is off, reattach the removable battery and restart the computer. If the computer does not start with the removable battery reattached, remove the removable battery and again start with step 2. If the computer starts with ac power but does not start when the removable battery is attached, call the Customer Support Center for support.\n3. While the computer is off, remove all sources of power (removable battery and the ac power adapter). Remove all external devices that are attached to your computer (keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, and so on). Repeat step 2.

        "text": "Static electricity prevention\n\n\nStatic electricity, although harmless to you, can seriously damage computer components and options. Improper handling of static-sensitive parts can cause damage to the part. When you unpack an option or a Customer Replaceable Unit (CRU), do not open the static-protective package until the instructions direct you to install the part.\n\nWhen you handle options or CRUs, or perform any work inside the computer, take the following precautions to avoid static-electricity damage:\n- Limit your movement. Movement can cause static electricity to build up around you.\n- Always handle components carefully. Handle adapters, memory modules, and other circuit boards by the edges. Never touch exposed circuitry.\n- Prevent others from touching the components.\n- Before you install a static-sensitive option or CRU, do either of the following to reduce static electricity in the package and your body:\n- Touch the static-protective package that contains the part to a metal expansion-slot cover for at least two seconds.\n- Touch the static-protective package that contains the part to other unpainted metal surface on the computer for at least two seconds.\n- When possible, remove the static-sensitive part from the static-protective package and install the part without setting it down. When this is not possible, place the static-protective package on a smooth, level surface and place the part on the package.\n- Do not place the part on the computer cover or other metal surface.\n\nDisabling the built-in battery\n\nBefore replacing any $C R U$, ensure that you disable Fast Startup first and then disable the built-in battery.\nTo disable Fast Startup, do the following:\n1. Go to Control Panel, and then change the view of Control Panel from Category to Large icons or Small icons.\n2. Click Power Options, and then click Choose what the power buttons do on the left pane.\n3. Click Change settings that are currently unavailable at the top.\n4. If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click Yes.\n5. Clear the Turn on fast startup check box, and then click Save changes.\n\nTo disable the built-in battery, do the following:\n1. Restart your computer. When the logo screen is displayed, immediately press F1 to enter ThinkPad Setup.\n2. Select Config $\\rightarrow$ Power. The Power submenu is displayed.\n3. Select Disable built-in battery and press Enter.\n4. Select Yes in the Setup Confirmation window. The built-in battery is disabled and the computer turns off automatically. Wait three to five minutes to let the computer cool.\n\nReplacing the removable battery\n\nBefore you start, read \"Important safety information\" on page $v$ and print the following instructions.",
