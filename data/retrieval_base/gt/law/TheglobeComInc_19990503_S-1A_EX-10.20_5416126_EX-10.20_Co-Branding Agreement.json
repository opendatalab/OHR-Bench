The only login or registration that should be required to access the Service or the Co-Brande Pages is theglobe Site's login or registration. Because Boxlot hosts the Service and the Co-Branded Pages, theglobe will pass to Boxlot information about each User accessing the Service or the Co-Branded Pages as described below:\n\nAccounts will be created for each User via a one-time \"welcome\" page (hosted by theglobe) when the User tries to access the portion of the Service requiring such registration for the first time.\n$\\cdot$ The \"welcome\" page will include registration fields for any information about the User needed to use the Service but not currently in theglobe's database.\n- The \"welcome\" page will include a \"Privacy Policy\" informing the User that their data is being passed to a third party (Boxlot) in order to use the Services.\n- Any additional required User information is collected and entered into theglobe's database. Then, the required User information is sent to Boxlot all at once to create the new account. theglobe will include the User's \"username\" and \"UserID\\#\" in the data passed to Boxlot.\n\nAdditional notes on account creation:\n. The User will only see the \"Welcome\" page until they consent to the privacy policy and enter any required information. This page will not appear after the User completes the initial account creation process.\n\nAccount information stored on Boxlot's servers in connection to the Service will need to be kept in parity with theglobe. To do so, the parties shall work together to implement a mechanism for updating information on Boxlot's servers when User information changes on theglobe Site.\n\nThe technology used to pass the data to Boxlot for account creation and ongoing account updates will be determined jointly by Boxlot and theglobe.\n\nThe UserID\\# theglobe passes to Boxlot during account creation will be stored by Boxlot in association with each User. This UserID\\# is necessary Eo link individual user reporting and individual account updates between Boxlot and theglobe on an ongoing basis."
