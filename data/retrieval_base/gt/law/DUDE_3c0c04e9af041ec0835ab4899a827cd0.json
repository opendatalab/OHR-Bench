If it requires experiment and invention to make and use the matter described, the patent is invalid; \", and to the same effect the like doctrine has been declared in Curtis on Patents, section 255 ; Turner vs. Winter, 1 D. and E. 602 ; Evans v.s. Eaton, 7 Wheat, 35̃6; McFarlane $r$ rs. Price, 1st Stark, 1058 ; The King vs. Arkwright. 1 Webs. Patent Cases, 64.\n\nBecanse of the fact that under our practice the courts are without power to afford relief to an inventor if his patent is varrower in scope than his invention, it becomes of prime importance that it should be drawn by those only who are skilled in this department of patent practice, in order that this instrument, which is the contract wherein his rights are pointed ont by metes and bounds, may include in it that full, clear and exact description contemplated by the statute, and those clauses designated as claims, so full as to positively and unmistakably extend to and embrace every feature of novelty to which the inventor is entitled.\n\nIn this connection the matter of competent counsel has been considered of so great importance that it has received official notice and been reduced to a written rule. The Rules of Practice of the Patent Office, under the revision of September 1st, 1880, embody the following : ${ }^{66}$ As the value of patents depends largely upon the careful preparation of the specifications and claims, the assistance of competent counsel will in most cases be of advantage to the applicant; but the value of their services will be proportion-",

It may be issued in the name of the inventor and his assignees; or to him, as the inventor, and to the assignees as the owners.\n\nHOW TO OBTAIN A VALID PATENT.\n\nThe first step to be taken in this direction is to ascertain whether the invention is patentable, or whether it, or any substantial part thereof, has been patented by another.\n\nFor this purpose a preliminary examination is advisable in every instance, and it consists in making a thorough and exhaustive search in the Patent Office through the class to which the invention appertains.

But for a special search of the character just referred to, we make a charge of five dollars in advance, which fee, should the report be unfavorable, covers the cost of copies of the references, which copies we forward. But should the examination result favorably, we report accordingly, and require a renittance of fifteen dollars, the first Government fee. On receipt of this fee, we immediately prepare the necessary drawings, the petition, oath, and specification, and forward them for the inventor's personal inspection and execution. When these papers are returned to us, together with fifteen dollars, part of our professional charge, the case is promptly filed in the Patent Office, and diligently prosecuted. When the application is allowed, the remaining installment of the agency fee, mamely, fifteen clollars, is clue. The final Govermment fee of twenty dollars can be paid at any time within six months from the flate of the allowance ; but in every instance we advise, in fact recommend. its prompt payment, as delay in this particular not infrequently involves the applicant in a vexatious litigation known as an interference.",

There is a great number of existing patents which are so poorly illustrated as to make it a difficult matter to ascertain exactly what construction was inteuded by the inventor. Such defects prove a source of serious trouble when it is desired to dispose of a patent or to test the validity of the same should it be brought before a court; the ambignity thus arising making it also necessary to enter into certain explanations regarding the exact construction of the device, when negotiating with purchasers and manufacturers.

The object of the opinions here alluded to, is to ascertain these facts. To the proper preparation of them it is essential that thorough investigation should be made throngh the U.

Opinions of the character here referred to are also of use in this connection.\n\nIf by investigation it is as certained that the threats are unfounded, opinions containing a full and accurate statement of the facts may be distributed among the trade, and thus relieve them from any further fear of purchasing the alleged infringing goods.
