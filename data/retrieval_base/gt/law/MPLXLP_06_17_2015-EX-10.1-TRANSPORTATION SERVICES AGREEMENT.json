All Product barrels moved by Shipper in excess of its Quarterly Volume Commitment will be attributed to Shipper's movements on the Pipeline as a Regular Shipper, subject to the applicable Rules \\& Regulations of the Tariff.\n3.6 The dollar amount of any Quarterly Deficiency Payment paid by Shipper shall constitute prepayment for transportation of Product by Shipper on the Pipeline and will posted as a credit (\"Prepaid Transportation Credits\") to Shipper's account for that type of Product. If, during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment requirements, Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for such Quarter. Any Prepaid Transportation Credits that are not used by Shipper during the four (4) Quarters immediately following the Quarter for which said Prepaid Transportation Credits were posted to Shipper's account (the \"Credit Period\") will expire. Those Prepaid Transportation Credits that are in payment dispute in accordance with Section 3.4, shall be posted as a credit on the date the payment dispute is resolved. If during any such four (4) Quarter period the nominated volume on the Pipeline for any month equals or exceeds the applicable portion in the Quarterly Volume Commitment for the Pipeline for such month (the \"Monthly Commitment\"), but Shipper is prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment because of lack of available capacity, either because (a) the Pipeline is in allocation and Shipper is specifically subject to allocation per Exhibit C, (b) the Pipeline is undergoing testing, maintenance or repair, or (c) a Force Majeure has occurred that prevents MPL from transporting Shipper volumes on the Pipeline in excess of the Monthly Commitment, then the Credit Period shall be extended by an equivalent time period for which Shipper has been prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment.

Condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent are interchangeable from a volume commitment standpoint and shipping a total volume of any one or combination of these Products will be applied towards the Quarterly Volume Commitment.

MPL will provide at least sixty (60) days' advance written notice, simultaneously, to all shippers (including Shipper) who have executed a transportation service agreement during the binding open season of the availability and volume of Unsubscribed Capacity for additional volume commitments (the \"Additional Volume Commitments\"). No later than thirty (30) days following the date of MPL's written notice, Shipper must provide MPL with a written binding commitment identifying the additional volumes to be added to its Quarterly Volume Commitment (\"Pre-Service Increase Request\"). In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that are, in aggregate, less than or equal to the Unsubscribed Capacity, each shipper's volume commitment shall be increased by the volume of its Pre-Service Increase Request. In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that would, in aggregate, exceed the Unsubscribed Capacity, all Shippers will be allocated their Pre-Service Increases pro rata based on their thencurrent volume commitments. If Shipper makes a Pre-Service Increase Request, MPL shall notify Shipper of its new Quarterly Volume Commitment within thirty (30) days following receipt of Shipper's Pre-Service Increase Request, and Exhibit C shall be deemed revised to reflect Shipper's new volume commitment, which shall equal the sum of its original Capacity Request Form volume commitment and its Pre-Service Increase Request or its allocated portion thereof pursuant to this Section 3.9. If there is still Unsubscribed Capacity after shippers (including Shipper) exercise Additional Volume Commitments as set forth above, MPL may conduct a second open season to obtain additional volume commitments for any remaining Unsubscribed Capacity.\n4. Transportation Charges\n4.1 Shipper shall pay MPL a transportation charge for each Barrel of Product shipped under the terms of this Agreement and Exhibit C, at the rates provided for in Exhibit B, which shall be the Tariff Rates for the volume commitment on the Day of delivery of Product.\n\nThe rates in Exhibit B will be adjusted annually in accordance with the standard FERC annual oil pipeline indexing methodology in effect at the time of the escalation. There shall be no downward adjustment of the Rates in the event the annual FERC oil pipeline index rate is negative. Rates will typically be indexed during July of each year and would be first indexed in July of the year following project completion."

The rates vary depending upon project options, but in all instances will be $\\$ 0.01$ per barrel above the rates for uncommitted service for the same origin and destination points. A Committed Priority Shipper will have the same rates as the Committed Non-Priority Shipper (as defined below), unless the system in under prorationing. When under prorationing, the Committed Priority Shipper's rate will be charged the premium rate of $\\$ 0.01$ above the posted uncommitted rate.

Those who elect to become a Committed Non-Priority Shipper will receive the benefit of discounted rates that will not be available to the Committed Priority Shippers or the uncommitted shippers. The rates will vary depending upon project options and commitment duration. MPL will not presume Shipper to be a Committed Non-Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement, unless the Capacity Request Form submitted by Shipper during MPL's binding open season (Exhibit C) shows the Shipper has elected Committed Non-Priority Shipper Status.\n\n\n5. Force Majeure\n\n5.1 As soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure event, the affected Party shall provide the other Party written notice of the occurrence of such Force Majeure event (a \"Force Majeure Notice\"). A Party shall identify the full particulars and the approximate length of time that the Party reasonably believes in good faith such Force Majeure event shall continue (the \"Force Majeure Period\").

For the avoidance of doubt, neither Party may exercise its right under this Section 5.1 to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeure event with respect to any machinery, storage, tanks, lines of pipe or other equipment that has been unaffected by, or has been restored to working order since, the applicable Force Majeure event."

Termination and Amendment\n\n10.1 This Agreement may not be terminated, except as expressly provided herein, nor may any of its provisions be amended or waived without prior written consent of both Parties hereto.\n10.2 Neither failure nor delay by MPL or Shipper to exercise any right or remedy provided herein shall operate as a waiver with respect to a future exercise thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.\n10.3 Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.5, in the event of any breach of a term or condition of this Agreement by either Party, the other Party's remedy shall be limited to the direct damages caused thereby and in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party for any consequential, indirect, pecuniary, punitive, or economic damages, howsoever caused.\n10.4 Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a default by Shipper, pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement or any other termination of this Agreement initiated by Shipper pursuant to Section 5, Shipper shall have the right to require MPL to enter into a new transportation service agreement with Shipper that (a) is consistent with the terms and objectives set forth in this Agreement and (b) has commercial terms that are, in the aggregate, equal to or more favorable to Shipper than fair market value terms as would be agreed by similarly-situated parties negotiating at arm's length provided.\n10.5 Shipper acknowledges that MPL will incur certain building, expansion and improvement costs associated with its performance under this Agreement prior to the commencement of transportation service on the Pipeline. Shipper also acknowledges that MPL relied on the volume commitments received from Shipper on its Capacity Request Form in Exhibit C as part of an aggregate volume commitment received from all committed shippers during the binding open season to finalize the Project's ultimate scope, including but not limited to, pipe size, routing and destinations. If MPL is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Shipper decides to terminate this Agreement after the Effective Date but prior to the commencement of transportation service on the Pipeline, Shipper shall notify MPL of its decision to terminate within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date to allow MPL the opportunity to provide Shipper's unwanted capacity to other interested shippers as Unsubscribed Capacity as set forth in Section 3.8. If Shipper fails to notify MPL within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date or if MPL is unsuccessful in obtaining additional volume commitments as provided for in Section 3.8 to"

The Parties agree that the Construction Cost Reimbursement shall be deemed liquidated damages and that such amount shall not be deemed a penalty, but rather represents a reasonable amount of liquidated damages in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by Shipper's termination of this Agreement as stated, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and that the payment of such amount shall be MPL's sole and exclusive remedy for such termination by Shipper.\n10.6 The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement may be contingent on the Shipper executing a reasonably acceptable commodity supply agreement. Shipper must notify MPL if it is unable to execute a reasonably acceptable commodity supply agreement within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project in-service date. Furthermore, Shipper must make commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a commodity supply agreement within the one hundred and eighty (180) days. Provided, however, that Shipper acknowledges and agrees that Shipper remains responsible for the Construction Cost Reimbursement provided for in Section 10.5 of this Agreement if it is unable to reach and execute a commodity supply agreement within the required timeframe.\n\n\n11. Conditions Precedent\n\n\nNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement is subject to the receipt by MPL of:\n11.1 All certificates, approvals and authorizations of any Governmental Authority deemed necessary or desirable by MPL in connection with this Agreement and, in each case, in form and substance acceptable to MPL in its sole discretion.\n11.2 Executed Transportation Service Agreements, in form and substance acceptable to MPL in its sole discretion, as MPL shall deem sufficient in its sole discretion to support the economic viability of the costs associated with the Project.\n11.3 Executed Transportation Service Agreements, in form and substance acceptable to both MPL and Shipper.\n\nIf any terms of this Agreement are required to be modified in accordance with a decision, approval or authorization from FERC or any other governmental authority, the Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with one another in amending this Agreement to align with those decisions, approvals and authorizations from FERC or any other governmental agencies. If these conditions precedent are not satisfied for MPL after exercising commercially reasonable efforts to meet such condition precedent, MPL shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Shipper. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 11, MPL and Shipper shall be released from any and all obligations under this Agreement.\n\n12.
