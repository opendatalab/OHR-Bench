McNutt, Director of the Office of Defense, Health and Welfare Services, met in Washington, D. C., in December 1941. The large attendance and diligent committee work showed plainly that there was a wide interest in gardening as a wartime activity. The delegates attending the Conference represented garden associations and clubs, the garden press, seed, horticultural and allied trade associations and papers, the farm press, radio stations, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Security Agency, the Office of Civilian Defense, the Work Projects Administration, national youth organizations, and other agencies. Discussion by the delegates revealed that there are already extensive farm home, community and school garden programs being carried on throughout the country by Government agencies, and that these programs will be expanded.\n\nIt was also apparent that there would be some expansion of home gardens. The conference agreed that due to the desirability of conserving seed, fertilizer, and spray material as well as the avoidance of disappointing results, home vegetable gardens should be confined to farms, small- and medium-sized towns, and suburban areas. It is recognized that while city gardening has health, recreational, and morale values, city back yards are seldom successful in the production of vegetables as the soil is usually poor and other conditions unfavorable. Therefore, it is desirable to continue the landscape improvement of city yards and not to destroy lawns and ornamental plantings for the sake of a few vegetables.\n\nChapter II\n\nPURPOSE OF THE VICTORY GARDEN PROGRAM\n\nThe Victory Garden Program will:\n1. Increase the production and consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits by more and better home, school, and community gardens, to the end that we become a stronger and healthier Nation.\n2. Encourage the proper storage and preservation of the surplus from such gardens for distribution and use by families producing it, local school lunches, welfare agencies, and for local emergency food needs.\n3. Enable families and institutions to save on the cost of vegetables and apply this saving to other necessary foods which must be purchased.\n4. Provide through the medium of community gardens, an opportunity for gardening by urban dwellers and others who lack suitable home garden facilities.\n5. Maintain and improve the morale and spiritual well-being of the individual, family, and Nation.\n\nThe beautification of the home and community by gardening provides healthful physical exercise, recreation, definite release from war stress and strain.",

        "text": "Chapter V\n\nTHE OFFICE OF CIVILIAN DEFENSE IN THE VICTORY GARDEN PROGRAM\n\nThe Office of Civilian Defense with its defense councils and volunteer offices has the responsibility of directing volunteers who wish to engage in the Victory Garden Program to the leaders of existing garden activities for advice and instruction. These leaders may be county agricultural agents, Farm Security Administration supervisors, vocational agriculture, home economics and other teachers, and Work Projects Administration garden supervisors.\n\nBefore initiating any garden program locally, the defense councils should ascertain from the county extension agents, local school officials, and club organizations what garden activities and programs are being carried on and what organizations, agencies, or local leaders are responsible for such group activities.\n\nHowever, where there is no organized garden program, and where there is a demand for one, the defense councils may find it advisable to help volunteer gardeners to organize an appropriate program. In such cases the guide for planning the local Victory Garden Program, containing as it does, references to State, Federal, and other trained and authoritative personnel, will be of particular assistance.\n\nSuggestions for the local defense council\n1. Appoint as Victory Garden chairman an experienced gardener with executive ability.\n2. Assist the chairman of the Victory Garden Program in making contacts with all agencies, organizations, and individuals who might contribute to the program.\n\nSuggestions for the volunteer office\n1. Acquaint volunteers with purpose and opportunities for service in the Victory Garden Program.\n2. Refer to the Victory Garden chairman all interested and qualified volunteers. The defense council should assume these functions where there is no volunteer office.\n\nChapter VI\n\nGUIDE FOR ORGANIZATION\nI. The local defense council should appoint an experienced gardener with executive ability as chairman of the Victory Garden committee.\nII. The Victory Garden chairman should select competent persons to act on the general committee as chairmen of the following subcommittees:\n1. Land, equipment, and supplies for gardening.\n2. Equipment and supplies for preservation and storage.\n3. Personnel and training.\n4. Publicity and information.\n5. Transportation.",
