        "text": "The Congressional Budget Office's Work in 2018: A Report to the Congress\n\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office was established under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide information that would support the Congressional budget process and help the Congress make effective budget and economic policy. CBO's work follows processes specified in that law and subsequent laws or developed by the agency in concert with the budget committees and the Congressional leadership. The agency's chief responsibility under the Budget Act is to help the budget committees with the matters under their jurisdiction. CBO also supports other Congressional committees-particularly the Appropriations, Ways and Means, and Finance Committees, as the Budget Act requires-and the leadership of the House and Senate.\n\nThe agency is committed to providing information that is:\n- Objective and insightful—representing the consensus and diversity of views of experts from around the country and applying the best new evidence as well as the lessons of experience;\n- Clearly presented and explained-so that policymakers and analysts understand the basis for the agency's findings and have the opportunity to question the analysis and methods used; and\n- Timely-responding as quickly as possible to the needs of the Congress.\n\nIn keeping with CBO's mandate to provide analysis that is objective and impartial, the agency makes no policy recommendations. Instead, it strives to present fully and fairly the likely consequences of alternative proposals\nbeing considered by the Congress so that lawmakers can make informed policy choices.\n\nTo fulfill its mission, CBO analyzes trends and recent developments related to the economy and the budget. It also develops baseline projections, which incorporate the assumption that current law generally does not change, for the next 10 years and the longer term. Those baseline projections serve as neutral benchmarks for gauging the effects of spending and revenue proposals relative to what would occur if current laws generally remained unchanged. Using those benchmarks in most of its analyses, the agency does the following:\n- Issues formal cost estimates for almost all bills reported by committees of the House and Senate, including estimates of the cost of intergovernmental and private-sector mandates;\n- Provides background information and technical assistance while legislation is being developed and while amendments are being considered by the House and Senate;\n- Estimates the cost of all appropriation bills;\n- Prepares analytic reports and working papersincluding testimony about the outlook for the economy and the budget, analysis of the President's budget, and studies on a broad range of budgetary and economic issues;\n- Posts files of data on its website documenting its baseline projections and providing other information underlying the analytic reports; and",

        "text": "- Publishes descriptions of policy options that would reduce budget deficits, as well as information to clearly present and explain CBO's analyses.\n\nThe agency employs analysts with many types of expertise who support the Congress in collaboration with managers and support staff. At the beginning of January 2019, 245 positions at CBO were filled, with the largest concentration in the area of health (see Table 1).\n\nInformation Provided to the Congress in 2018\n\nAs it does each year, CBO analyzed trends and recent developments related to the economy and the budget during calendar year 2018 and developed baseline projections. Using those projections as benchmarks in most of its analyses, CBO provided almost a thousand formal cost estimates and mandate statements, fulfilled several thousand requests for background and technical information, produced nearly 150 scorekeeping estimates for appropriation bills, and published many analytic reports, working papers, and other documents.\n\nIn providing all of that information, CBO tried to be transparent and responsive. As Director Keith Hall testified last year, the agency has recently been bolstering its efforts to be transparent, building on a strong foundation laid over many years. Those efforts aim to promote a thorough understanding of CBO's work, help people gauge how estimates might change if policies or circumstances differed, and enhance the credibility of CBO's analyses and processes. ${ }^{1}$\n\nFormal Cost Estimates and Mandate Statements\n\nCBO completed 947 formal cost estimates in 2018. They generally included explanations of their components and of the estimating methods used. The vast majority also included mandate statements, which assess whether legislation contains intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and, if so, assess the magnitude of the mandates' effects on the private sector and on state, local, and tribal governments. CBO completed nearly all cost estimates before the legislation came to a floor vote.\n\n\n1. For more detail about CBO's transparency efforts in 2018, see Congressional Budget Office, Transparency at CBO: Future Plans and Work in 2018 (December 2018), www.cbo.gov/ publication/54885.\n\n\nCost estimates for 69 opioid-related bills required especially significant effort. So did the estimates for the:\n- Advanced Nuclear Energy Technologies Act;\n- Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018;\n- Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2018;\n- Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act;\n- Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019;\n- National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019;\n- Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity Through Education Reform Act;\n- Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act;\n- San Juan County Settlement Implementation Act;\n- Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2017;\n- VA Care in the Community Act; and\n- VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018.\n\nBackground Information and Technical Assistance\n\nCBO provides considerable assistance and many preliminary estimates when legislative proposals are still at the early stages of development. Such information is generally provided to committees or the leadership of the House or Senate. Similar information is also provided as part of the legislative process when amendments are being considered. CBO fulfilled several thousand requests for it in 2018.\n\nScorekeeping Tabulations\n\nOn an ongoing basis during 2018, CBO provided spending estimates with account-level detail for individual appropriation bills at all stages of the legislative process. Those tabulations totaled 149 last year. The agency also periodically provided summary tables showing the status of discretionary appropriations (by appropriations subcommittee) and running totals on a year-to-date basis.",

In 2018, CBO described its baseline projections in a major\nreport about the budget and economic outlook. It provided a comprehensive analysis of the long-term outlook for the federal budget-that is, the outlook over the next 30 years and an analysis of economic outcomes under different budgetary paths. In addition, CBO produced an analysis of the President's budgetary proposals and a volume describing 121 policy options for reducing budget deficits. A digital version of the volume was also developed, including a tool that allows users to search by keyword. Besides those major reports, the agency produced many other analyses of budget and economic issues. All told, the agency produced 70 such publications; they are arrayed by category below.\n\nPROJECTIONS AND BUDGET ISSUES IN MAJOR RECURRING REPORTS\nOptions for Reducing the Deficit: 2019 to 2028\n(December)\n\nAn Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028\n(August)\n\nThe 2018 Long-Term Budget Outlook (June)\nAn Analysis of the President's 2019 Budget (May)\nThe Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028 (April)\n\nBUDGET ISSUES\nMonthly Budget Review (12 issues)\nA Review of CBO's Estimate of the Effects of the Recovery Act on SNAP (December)\n\nThe Accuracy of CBO's Baseline Estimates for Fiscal Year 2018 (December)\n\nFunding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agencies' Base Budgets (December)\n\nThe Deficit Reductions Necessary to Meet Various Targets for\nFederal Debt (August)\n\nSequestration Update Report: August 2018 (August)\n\nThe Long-Term Budget Outlook Under Alternative\nScenarios for Fiscal Policy (August)\nCBO's Projections of Federal Receipts and Expenditures in the National Income and Product Accounts (July)",

One indicator of the strength of its internal operations was the agency's recognition by the Partnership for Public Service as one of the best places to work in the federal government; it ranked third overall among 29 small agencies. That assessment was derived from survey data about the match between employees' skills and\nagencies' mission, the balance between employees' work and the rest of their life, the strength of communication within the agencies, and the effectiveness of the agencies' leadership.\n\nTo ensure that staff members stay current on topics that are important to CBO's work for the Congress, the agency hosted presentations by a broad range of outside researchers and other experts, and staff members participated in numerous seminars to share information about their analyses, data, and estimating techniques. CBO also sustained its emphasis on training. Staff members participated in conferences of researchers, practitioners, and government employees on various economic and policy topics, as well as training in analytic tools and various skills. CBO continued to emphasize the need to clearly communicate the results of analyses, providing courses on writing analytic reports and training on effective presentation skills and data visualization. Finally, CBO provided staff with extensive training in soft skills and provided managers with training in engaging employees, enhancing productivity, and the value of diverse teams.\n\nCBO's long-standing policy is to provide equal opportunity to all employees and applicants for employment in accordance with the Congressional Accountability Act (and now in accordance with the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act, which amended the earlier law in 2018) and all applicable laws and regulations. CBO values the diversity of its workforce, believing that attracting and retaining a diverse workforce is a crucial part of ensuring that the agency has the best possible staff and that the agency's work benefits from different perspectives and experiences. As part of that effort, CBO periodically analyzes the representation of women and minorities in its workforce. Overall, 45 percent of CBO's employees are women: 33 percent of its managers, 46 percent of its analysts (nearly all of whom have advanced degrees), and 51 percent of its other professionals, who provide technical and administrative support to the agency. Of CBO's employees, 21 percent are minorities: 9 percent of its managers, 17 percent of its analysts, and 39 percent of its other professionals. CBO is using those findings to identify and address challenges in becoming more diverse.",
