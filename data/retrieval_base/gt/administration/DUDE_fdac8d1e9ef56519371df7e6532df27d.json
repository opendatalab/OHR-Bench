        "text": "Highlights\n\nThe year 2015 witnessed many significant achievements of the Indian Space programme which caught the attention of the country as well as the outside world. With the successful completion of the intended six month period by Mars Orbiter Spacecraft in its orbit around Planet Mars, India became the first country to achieve total success in its maiden attempt to explore Mars. Besides, the second consecutively successful launch of GSLV-MkII carrying the indigeneous Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) underscored ISRO's capability in cryogenic rocket propulsion. The year also saw the launch of India's multi wavelength Space Observatory ASTROSAT and its successful operationalisation.\n\nAdditionally, launch of IRNSS-1D and IRNSS-1E - the fourth and fifth satellites of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) - by PSLV-C27 and PSLV-C31 respectively into the required sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbits (sub-GTO), also occurred during the year 2015-16. The year also witnessed the launch of India's latest communication satellite GSAT-15 carrying communication transponders and GAGAN payload. And, the launch by the workhorse PSLV of 17 foreign satellites, 11 of them in two dedicated commercial PSLV missions, is yet another highlight of the Indian space programme during the reporting period.\n\nThe significant events of the Indian space programme during 2015-16 in chronological order are:\n- On March 24, 2015, India's Mars Orbiter Spacecraft, which had earlier successfully entered into the scheduled orbit around planet Mars, completed the intended six month period in Mars orbit. As of February 2016 end, the spacecraft had completed seventeen months of operation in Mars orbit.\n- IRNSS-1D, the fourth of the seven satellites constituting the IRNSS Constellation, was successfully launched by PSLV-C27 into a sub GTO on March 28, 2015. It was the $29^{\\text {th }}$ launch of PSLV as well as its $28^{\\text {th }}$ consecutively successful mission. IRNSS constellation will enable introduction of satellite based position, timing and velocity services to a spectrum of users in the country and to the neighbouring regions.\n- PSLV-C28, the $30^{\\text {th }}$ flight of PSLV, was conducted on July 10 , 2015, in which the vehicle placed United Kingdom's three DMC3 satellites, each weighing 447 kg , along with two auxiliary payloads, also from United Kingdom, into the required Sun Synchronous Orbit of 647 km height.\n- GSLV-D6, the ninth flight of GSLV as well as the third flight of GSLV carrying indigenously developed Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS), conducted on August 27, 2015, successfully launched 2117 kg GSAT-6 communication satellite into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). It was the second consecutive success for GSLV carrying indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage (GSLV-MkII).\n- ASTROSAT, India's first multi wavelength astronomy mission, was successfully launched by PSLV-C30 along with six co-passenger satellites from abroad, into a 650 km orbit of 6 deg inclination on September 28, 2015.",

This was the thirty first consecutive success of PSLV.\n- IRNSS-1E, fifth of the seven satellites constituting IRNSS Constellation, was successfully launched on-board PSLV-C31 on January 20, 2016 into a sub Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (sub GTO).\n\nBy February 2016 end, ISRO had a constellation of several commercial Communication satellites, exclusive Meteorological satellites, Earth Observation satellites, Navigation Satellites, a multi wavelength astronomical observatory and a spacecraft orbiting planet Mars.\n\nLaunch Vehicle Programme\n\nDuring the year under review, ISRO's workhorse Launch Vehicle PSLV, in its 'XL\" version, placed two Navigation Satellites IRNSS-1D and 1E in the required sub Geosynchronous Transfer Orbits in two separate flights - PSLV-C27 and PSLV-C31. Besides, the 'XL' version of PSLV launched five satellites from United Kingdom successfully into a 647 km Sun Synchronous Orbit in its $30^{\\text {th }}$ flight (PSLV-C28). PSLV-XL also launched India's first multi-wavelength space observatory ASTROSAT along with six customer satellites from abroad, in its thirty first flight (PSLV-30). In its 'Core Alone' version, PSLV placed six satellites from Singapore including the 400 kg Satellite TeLeos-1 into a 550 km Orbit, further proving its reliability and versatility.\n\nAnother prominent development in the Indian launch vehicle programme was the second consecutively successful flight (GSLV-D6) of GSLV-MkII on August 27, 2015, which was equipped with indigenous cryogenic upper stage. This flight further highlighted ISRO's strength in cryogenic propulsion technologies.\n\nActivities pertaining to LVM3 (GSLV-MkIII) launch vehicle, capable of launching four ton satellites into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), progressed well during the year with the successful ground test of its S200 booster to validate the changes in its head end segment as well as the flight and the extended duration hot (ground) tests of CE-20 cryogenic engine of its third stage.\n\nThis apart, research and development activities in semi-cryogenic propulsion engine, air breathing propulsion and re-usable launch vehicle technology are also being pursued in earnest in an effort towards reducing the cost of access to space. Development of critical technologies for undertaking human spaceflight has also made additional progress.",

All systems onboard the spacecraft are functioning normally in its orbit around Mars and it has already sent a number pictures of Mars disc showing many details. By February 2016 end, the spacecraft had successfully completed 17 months in its orbit around Mars.\n\nAnother prominent highlight of the year was yet another space science mission - ASTROSAT which was successfully launched on September 28, 2015 by India's workhorse launch vehicle PSLV. ASTROSAT is India's first multi wavelength observatory capable of simultaneously viewing the Universe in the visible, Ultra violet and X-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. After its launch into the planned orbit, ASTROSAT became operational following extensive in orbit test of its five payloads.\n\nThe future space science missions of ISRO include Chandrayaan-2, a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-1 with an Orbiter, Lander and Rover to explore the moon, is to be launched onboard GSLV and Aditya-1, a scientific mission for solar studies carrying five scientific payloads including a Coronagraph. ADITYA is planned to be placed in a halo orbit around the L1 Legrangian point.\n\nSpace Applications and Disaster Management Support\n\nRemote Sensing applications projects at National, State and Local levels are being carried out through well-established multi-pronged implementation architecture of National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) in the country. During the year, Indian Remote Sensing Satellite constellation helped in Agricultural Crops Inventory, Agricultural Drought, Forest Fire, Landslides and Earthquakes monitoring, Groundwater Prospects Mapping, Inventory; Monitoring of Glacial Lakes/Water Bodies, Sericulture Development and Satellite Aided Search and Rescue.\n\nThe hallmark of Indian space programme has been the application-oriented efforts and the benefits that have accrued to the country. The societal services offered by INSAT/GSAT satellites in the area of teleeducation and telemedicine were continued during the year. Today, tele-education network has about 60,000 class rooms connected to various academic institutions and universities. ISRO Telemedicine network facilities now cover 380 hospitals connecting 302 rural hospitals and 18 mobile vans to 60 super speciality hospitals for providing health care to citizens, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe Disaster Management Support (DMS) Programme of ISRO continues to provide space based information and services to the State and Central Government Departments to strengthen the disaster management activities. The major activities during the year were monitoring all the flood events, supporting the disaster management during the Nepal Earthquake and monitoring the landslide dammed Phutkal river in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2015, flood monitoring and mapping was carried out for floods in 10 states and more than 105 flood maps were disseminated to the concerned State and Central officers in addition to making available to Users on the web through Bhuvan and NDEM web portals. LIDAR based experimental flood depth maps for part of Lakhimpur district of Assam were generated and disseminated to the state agencies for severe floods during August 23 and 25 and September 4, 2015.",
