This fact sheet was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women's Health (OWH). OWH coordinates women's health efforts, works with federal agencies and external partners to address important women's health topics, and supports policies that improve access to health care services. Please visit the Community Guide for much more information.\n\n[1] Xu, JQ, Murphy, SL., Kochanek, KD, Bastian, BA. Deaths: Final data for 2013 National Vital Statistics Report. 2016:64(2).

Death from cancer, stroke, and diseases of the heart decreased $25 \\%, 11 \\%$, and $4 \\%$ respectively. Unfortunately, though, deaths increased due to unintentional injuries such as falls and drug overdoses (both prescription and illicit drugs). For more information, read the article, Potentially Preventable Deaths Among the Five Leading Causes of Death--United States, 2010 and 2014.\n\nSurgeon General Releases Report on Substance Misuse\n\nSubstance misuse and substance use disorders have become a public health crisis in the United States. In November 2016, the U.S. Surgeon General released the first-ever report on substance misuse. The report, entitled Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health addresses substance misuse, related consequences, a vision for the future, and recommendations for various stakeholder groups such as individuals and families, health care providers, communities, and researchers. The full report can be found here as well as supplementary materials such as report highlights, fact sheets, and social media messages.\n\nTohacco Use Rates Declines but 40\\% of Diagnosed Cancers Linked to Tobacco Use\n\nTobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. Over the past few years, the smoking rate has been decreasing among U.S. adults. In a newly released Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the CDC reported that the percentage of U.S. adults",

Additionally, daily smokers decreased from $16.9 \\%$ to $11.4 \\%$.\n\nThe bad news though is that while 1.3 million tobacco-related cancer deaths have been avoided since 1990 and the smoking rate is declining, $40 \\%$ of all cancers diagnosed are linked to tobacco use and three in 10 cancer deaths are caused by cigarette smoking. In November 2016's Vital Signs, the CDC addresses cancer and tobacco. It is never too late to quit tobacco; quitting at any age can reduce your risk of getting or dying from cancer.\n\nEvidence-Based Performance Exercise Training Heightens Navy's Command Fitness Leader Program\n\nPORTSMOUTH, Va. (NNS) -- Thirty Hampton Roads-based Sailors took part in the Department of the Navy's (DON) command fitness leader (CFL) training, Nov. 15-19 at Joint Expeditionary Base (JEB) Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nThe five-day training gave participants an opportunity to experience firsthand the Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System (NOFFS) -- the Navy's proven, evidence-based methodology to get and keep Sailors in top physical condition.\n\"The Navy Fitness Program has come a long way since I joined seven years ago,\" said Petty Officer 2nd Class Krystal Pierce, CFL for the \"Golden Warriors\" of Strike\n Fighter Squadron (VFA) 87. \"Attending CFL School this week at JEB Little Creek was a real eye-opener to the changes the Navy is incorporating for optimum fitness and nutrition. I am excited to be able to deliver all l've learned to my command, and to incorporate these programs into my daily life. The fitness team at JEB Little Creek provides a fantastic program.\"\n\n\nAccording to Susan Lowry, fitness director at JEB Little Creek-Fort Story and coordinator for the latest Norfolk area, fleet-based CFL training, participants are always made to feel part of the group during the training regardless of what level they're working at.\n\"The CFLs are the heart and soul of an exercise program at a command, but they don't always have the background,\" said Lowry. \"We're excited about the diversity of resources such as the NOFFS program we can bring to their commands. We have to have healthy Sailors. The CFLs and assistant CFLs will be able to utilize all the resources from NOFFS for any environment, even confined spaces.\"\n\nCommander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) plays a vital role in delivering the CFL curriculum and providing NOFFS training to CFLs Navywide.\n\"The Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System is in strong demand,\" said Tunde Ridley, manager of CNIC Navy Fitness Programs. \"Over the past 5 years, we have certified over 280 MWR (Morale, Welfare, and Recreation) instructors that are consistently taking NOFFS to the deckplate by teaching local NOFFS training courses at local installations.\"",
