        "text": "# \n● Use the dedicated charging cable, charging cradle, rated output voltage of   $5\\,\\lor,$   and rated output current of 1 A or higher to charge your watch. Charging the watch using a non-Huawei charger or a power bank may result in it taking a longer time to charge, the device being unable to charge fully, overheating, or other similar issues. Therefore, you are advised to purchase an official Huawei charger from an official Huawei sales outlet. ● Use a Huawei power adapter or other power adapters that comply with local and international security standards. Adapters that do not conform to the security standard may cause security issues. ● Keep the surface of the charging cradle clean. Make sure the watch is placed properly on the charging cradle and displaying the charging status. Avoid putting metal objects on the medal contacts of the charger too long, or repeatedly sticking and removing metal objects to the contacts, as this can result in short circuiting and other risks. (If you are using a metal strap, make sure that the metal contacts on the watch are in proper contact with that of the charger during charging. Try to keep the metal links of the strap from touching the metal contacts of the charger.) ● It is recommended that you lift the charging cradle to attach it to your watch. Ensure that the side of your watch with buttons is aligned with the charging port of the cradle. After the cradle and watch are connected properly, check to see if the charging icon is displayed. If you cannot see the charging icon, you may need to slightly adjust the position of the cradle until contact is established and the charging icon appears. ● Do not charge or use your watch in a hazardous environment, make sure there is nothing flammable or explosive nearby. When using the charging cradle, make sure there is no residual liquid or other foreign objects on the USB port of the charging cradle. Keep the charging cradle away from liquids and any flammable materials. Do not touch the charging contacts while the device is charging, or take any other unnecessary safety risks. ● There are magnets in the charging cradle, due to their nature they will also attract other medal objects, so it is important to check for any before using the charger. The charging cradle contains magnetic materials. It is important not to let it overheat by placing it out in the sun or somewhere too warm. ● When carrying and storing the charging cradle, make sure the charger stays dry, especially the USB port on the base, clean it to prevent foreign objects from entering the USB port, these can cause damage to the charger and may lead to other safety risks. ● Your watch will automatically power off when its battery level is too low. After it is charged for a while, your watch will automatically power on. \n# \nYour watch will be fully charged within two hours. When the charging indicator displays   $100\\%$  , the watch is fully charged. Disconnect your watch from the power adapter once it is fully charged. \n# \n● Charge your watch in a dry and well-ventilated environment. ● Before charging, make sure that the charging port and metal parts are clean and dry to prevent short circuits or any other risks. ● Before charging, make sure the charging port is dry. Wipe off any water or sweat stains. ● The charging cradle is not water resistant, so keep it dry at all times. ● It is recommended that the ambient temperature is between 0 and   $45^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$  . ● To protect the battery, the charging current will be reduced if the ambient temperature is low, which will prolong the charging time without affecting the battery lifespan."
