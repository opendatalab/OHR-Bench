        "text": "# \nObject Storage Service (OBS)  is a scalable service that provides secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud storage for massive amounts of data. \nOBS provides unlimited storage capacity for objects of any format, catering to the needs of common users, websites, enterprises, and developers. There is no limitation on the storage capacity of the entire OBS system or of a single bucket, and any number of objects can be stored. As a web service, OBS supports APIs over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). You can use OBS Console or OBS tools to access and manage data stored in OBS anytime, anywhere. With OBS SDKs and APIs, you can easily manage data stored in OBS and develop upper-layer applications. \nHuawei Cloud deploys OBS infrastructures in multiple regions across the globe, delivering high scalability and reliability. You can deploy OBS in specific regions for faster access at an affordable price. \n# \nOBS basically consists of  buckets  and  objects . \nA bucket is a container for storing objects in OBS. Each bucket is specific to a region and has specific storage class and access permissions. A bucket is accessible through its  access domain name  over the Internet. \nAn object is the fundamental storage unit in OBS. An object consists of the following:\n\n \n● A key that specifies the name of an object. An object key is a UTF-8 string up to 1,024 characters long. Each object is uniquely identified by a key within a bucket.\n\n ● Metadata that describes an object. The metadata is a set of key-value pairs that are assigned to objects stored in OBS. There are two types of metadata: system-defined metadata and custom metadata. – System-defined metadata is automatically assigned by OBS for processing objects. Such metadata includes Date, Content-Length, Last-Modified, ETag, and more."

        "text": "– You can specify custom metadata to describe the object when you upload an object to OBS. Data that refers to the content of an object. \nBy means of secondary development based on OBS REST APIs, OBS Console, SDKs, and a variety of tools are provided for you to use OBS. You can also use OBS SDKs and APIs to develop applications customized for your business needs. \nFigure 1-1  Product architecture \n# \nOBS offers the storage classes below to meet your requirements for storage performance and costs. You can  change buckets and objects between storage classes . To learn billing for different storage classes, see  Storage Space .\n\n \n● Standard: The Standard storage class features low latency and high throughput. It is therefore good for storing frequently (multiple times per month) accessed files or small files (less than 1 MB). Its application scenarios include big data analytics, mobile apps, hot videos, and social apps.\n\n ● Infrequent Access: The Infrequent Access storage class is for storing data that is infrequently (less than 12 times per year) accessed, but when needed, the access has to be fast. It can be used for file synchronization, file sharing, enterprise backups, and many other scenarios. This storage class has the same durability, low latency, and high throughput as the Standard storage class, with a lower cost, but its availability is slightly lower than the Standard storage class.\n\n ● Archive: The Archive storage class is ideal for storing data that is rarely (once per year) accessed. Its application scenarios include data archive and long- term backups. This storage class is secure, durable, and inexpensive, so it can be used to replace tape libraries. To keep cost low, it may take hours to restore data from the Archive storage class."

This storage class costs less than the Archive storage class, but takes longer time (usually several hours) to restore data. \nAn object uploaded to a bucket inherits the storage class of the bucket by default. You can also specify a storage class for an object when you upload it. \nChanging the storage class of a bucket does not change the storage classes of existing objects in the bucket, but newly uploaded objects will inherit the new storage class. \nTable 1-1  Comparison between storage classes \n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Compared Item} & \\textbf{Standard} & \\textbf{Infrequent Access} & \\textbf{Archive} & \\textbf{Deep Archive (Under Limited Beta Testing)}\\\\\n\\hline \nFeature & Top-notch performance , high reliability and availability & Reliable, inexpensive storage with real-time access & Long-term retention of archived data at a low cost & Lower price than the Archive storage class for long-term data archive.\\\\\n\\hline \nApplication scenarios & Cloud application, data sharing, content sharing, and hot data storage & Web disk applications, enterprise backup, active archiving, and data monitoring & Archive, medical image storage, video material, and storage, and replacement of tape libraries & Archiving data that is barely accessed.\\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Designed durability} & \\textbf{99.99999999} & \\textbf{99.99999999} \\% & \\textbf{99.99999999} \\% & 99.99999999 \\%\\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Designed durability (multi-AZ)} & \\textbf{99.9999999} \\% & \\textbf{99.99%} \\% & \\textbf{99.99%} \\% & \\textbf{\\textit{99.99999999}}\\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Designed availability} & \\textbf{99.99\\%} \\% & \\textbf{99\\%} \\% & \\textbf{99\\%} \\% & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textit{\\textbf{99\\%}}}\\\\\n\\hline \n\\textbf{Designed availability (multi-AZ)} & \\textbf{99.995\\%} & \\textbf{99.5\\%} \\% & \\textbf{Multi-AZ not supported} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textit{\\textbf{Multi-AZ not supported}}}\\\\\n\\hline \nMinimum storage duration & N/A & 30 days & 90 days & 180 days\\\\\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}"

There will usually be anonymous requests in the scenarios that require public access, for example, accessing a hosted static website. In most cases, requests for OBS resources must be authenticated. An authenticated request must include a signature. The signature is calculated based on the requester's access keys (a pair of AK and SK) that are used as the encryption factor and the specific information included in the request body. OBS uses an access key ID (AK) and a secret access key (SK) together to authenticate the identity of a requester.

Data uploaded to OBS is stored in buckets as objects. \nAn object consists of the following:\n\n \n● A key that specifies the name of an object. An object key is a UTF-8 string up to 1,024 characters long. Each object is uniquely identified by a key within a bucket.\n\n ● Metadata that describes an object. The metadata is a set of key-value pairs that are assigned to objects stored in OBS. There are two types of metadata: system-defined metadata and custom metadata. – System-defined metadata is automatically assigned by OBS for processing objects. Such metadata includes Date, Content-Length, Last-Modified, ETag, and more. – You can specify custom metadata to describe the object when you upload an object to OBS.\n\n ● Data that refers to the content of an object. \nGenerally, objects are managed as files. However, OBS is an object-based storage service and there is no concept of files and folders. For easy data management, OBS provides a method to simulate folders. By adding a slash   $(/)$   to an object name, for example,  test/123.jpg , you can specify  test  as a folder and  123.jpg  as the name of a file in the  test  folder. The key of the object is  test/123.jpg . \nWhen uploading an object, you can set a storage class for the object. If no storage class is specified, the object is stored in the same storage class as the bucket in which it resides. You can also change the storage class of an existing object in a bucket. \nOn OBS Console and OBS Browser+, you can use folders the same way you use them in a file system. \nFor details about object operations, see  Managing Objects ."

        "text": "# \nBuckets are containers for storing objects. OBS provides flat storage in the form of buckets and objects. Unlike the conventional multi-layer directory structure of file systems, all objects in a bucket are stored at the same logical layer. \nEach bucket has its own attributes, such as access permissions, storage class, and the region. You can specify access permissions, storage class, and regions when creating buckets. You can also configure advanced attributes to meet storage requirements in different scenarios. \nOBS provides the following storage classes for buckets: Standard, Infrequent Access, Archive, and Deep Archive (under limited beta testing). With support for these storage classes, OBS caters to diverse storage performance and cost requirements. When creating a bucket, you can specify a storage class for it, which can be changed later. \nEach bucket name in OBS is globally unique and cannot be changed after the bucket has been created. The region where a bucket resides cannot be changed once the bucket is created. When you create a bucket, OBS creates a default access control list (ACL) that grants users permissions (such as read and write permissions) on the bucket. Only authorized users can perform operations such as creating, deleting, viewing, and configuring buckets. \nAn account (including all IAM users under this account) can create a maximum of 100 buckets and parallel file systems. However, there is no restriction on the number and total size of objects in a bucket. \nOBS adopts the REST architectural style, and is based on HTTP and HTTPS. You can use URLs to locate resources. \nFigure 9-1  illustrates the relationship between buckets and objects in OBS. \nFigure 9-1  Relationship between objects and buckets \n\nFor details about bucket operations, see  Managing Buckets ."
