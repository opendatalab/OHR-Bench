The three stages of the Respecting Choices? model include First Steps?, for generally well adults; Next Steps?, for adults diagnosed with chronic or life-limiting diseases; and Last Steps?, for those with a life expectancy of less than one year (Hammes & Briggs, 2011). The staged planning process is intended to meet the ongoing needs of the adult with chronic and/or life-limiting diseases (Hammes, et al., 2012; Hickman, et al., 2009). \n# \nThe initiative for ACP started over twenty years ago in the national legislature. The effort was predicated by a number of court cases pleading for a patient's right to choose whether to receive medical treatment (Ulrich, 1999). Two of the more publicized cases were Karen Ann Quinlan v.State of New Jersey andNancy Cruzan v.Director, Missouri Department of Health (70 N.J.10 (1976) 355 A.2d 647;497 U.S.261,110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224, 1990 U.S., respectively). Both cases engendered significant press and publicity that argued over a patient's right to die. Subsequently, the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 (PSDA) passed through the United States Legislature and was enacted in 1991 (H.R. Res. 101\\*\" Cong. H. R. 4449 (1990). The PSDA provided the legal right for patients to determine which, if any, treatment options they preferred. It also allowed patients to appoint an advocate who would make decisions on their behalves in the event they were unable to do so (Duke, et al., 2009; Ulrich, 1999). The primary intention of the PSDA was to prevent cases similar to Quinlan’s or Cruzan's from reoccurring by increasing the availability and utility of AD documents (Ulrich). \nUnfortunately,theADdocuments thatfollowedwereoftenvague and left the interpretation of the document to the advocate (Andershed & Harstade, 2007;Kirchhoff,"
