In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital for each of the\n\n        Company's first and third fiscal quarters (as determined based on the\n\n        Company's first and third fiscal quarterly filed statutory financial\n\n        statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments or modifications\n\n        thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance department or the\n\n        Company's independent auditors) falls below the Specified Minimum\n\n        Percentage of the Company's projected Company Action Level RBC (in each\n\n        case as estimated by the Company as of the end of each such first and\n\n        third fiscal quarters, as the case may be), AIG shall, within the\n\n        respective time periods set forth under paragraph 4, in accordance with\n\n        paragraph 5 and in compliance with applicable law, provide to the\n\n        Company cash, cash equivalents, securities or other instruments that\n\n        qualify (as admitted assets) for purposes of calculating the Company's\n\n        Total Adjusted Capital, as a contribution and not as a loan, in an\n\n        amount such that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital as of the end of\n\n        each of the\n\n \n       Company's second and fourth fiscal quarter, as the case may be, will be\n\n        projected to be at least equal to the Specified Minimum Percentage of\n\n        the Company's Company Action Level RBC. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\n\n        AIG may, at any time as it deems necessary in its sole discretion and in\n\n        compliance with applicable law, make a contribution to the Company in\n\n        such amount as is required for the Company's Total Adjusted Capital to\n\n        equal a percentage of its Company Action Level RBC determined to be\n\n        appropriate by the Company and AIG.\n\n \n    2. In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital (a) for each of\n\n        the Company's first, second and third fiscal quarters (as determined\n\n        based on the Company's first, second and third fiscal quarterly filed\n\n        statutory financial statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments\n\n        or modifications thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance\n\n        department or the Company's independent auditors) is in excess of the\n\n        Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's projected Company Action\n\n        Level RBC (in each case as estimated by the Company as of the end of\n\n        each such first, second and third fiscal quarters, as the case may be)\n\n        or (b) as of each fiscal year end (as shown in the Company's fiscal\n\n        year-end filed statutory financial statements, together with any\n\n        adjustments or modifications thereto required by the Domiciliary State's\n\n        insurance department or the Company's independent auditors) is in excess\n\n        of the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action\n\n        Level RBC (as shown in such fiscal year-end statutory financial\n\n        statements), the Company shall, within the respective time periods set\n\n        forth under paragraph 4, in accordance with paragraph 5 and subject to\n\n        approval by the Company's board of directors as required by the laws of\n\n        the Domiciliary State, declare and pay dividends ratably to its equity\n\n        holders in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount\n\n        necessary to reduce the Company's projected or actual Total Adjusted\n\n        Capital as of each of the end of the Company's fiscal quarter or fiscal\n\n        year, as the case may be, to a level equal to or not materially greater\n\n        than the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action\n\n        Level RBC or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by the Domiciliary\n\n        State's law to be paid as an ordinary dividend less an amount that the\n\n        Company and AIG agree is appropriate to protect the Company from\n\n        exceeding such maximum amount allowed by such Domiciliary State's law as\n\n        a result of potential audit adjustments or adjustments to the\n\n        projections on which such dividend amount is based. For the avoidance of\n\n        doubt, this paragraph shall only require the Company to pay ordinary\n\n        dividends; under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay\n\n        any dividend which would trigger the"

Notwithstanding the\n\n        obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum\n\n        Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and\n\n        revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the\n\n        parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material\n\n        changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of\n\n        S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the\n\n        Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand,\n\n        which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that\n\n        under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or\n\n        instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is\n\n        treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand,\n\n        and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any\n\n        other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which\n\n        AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum\n\n        Percentage then in effect.\n\n \n    4. The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under\n\n        paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per\n\n        year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business\n\n        day after the filing of the Company's first fiscal\n\n \n\n       quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business\n\n        day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and\n\n        (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing\n\n        of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements\n\n        and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's\n\n        fourth fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with\n\n        applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1\n\n        may be made by AIG after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year\n\n        of the Company but prior to the filing by the Company of its statutory\n\n        financial statements for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year,\n\n        respectively, and contributions of this nature shall be recognized as\n\n        capital contributions receivable as of the balance sheet date of the yet\n\n        to be filed quarterly or annual financial statement (as the case may\n\n        be), pursuant to paragraph 8 of Statement of Statutory Accounting\n\n        Principles No. 72, to the extent approved by the Domiciliary State. The\n\n        Company and AIG further agree that any dividends to be made under\n\n        paragraph 2 will take place as soon as practicable after the filing by\n\n        the Company of the relevant fiscal quarter-end or fiscal year-end\n\n        statutory financial statements or such earlier time as may be agreed by\n\n        the Company and AIG.\n\n \n    5. At the time that any contribution is due under paragraph 4, AIG agrees\n\n        that it will either (a) make such contribution to the Company's direct\n\n        parent and cause such direct parent to then contribute such funds,\n\n        securities or instruments so contributed by AIG to the Company, or\n\n        (b) make such contribution directly to the Company without receiving any\n\n        capital stock or other ownership interest in exchange therefor, subject\n\n        in either case to any required regulatory approvals. At any time any\n\n        dividends are due under paragraph 4, the Company agrees that it will\n\n        make such dividend to the Company's direct parent and will use its best\n\n        efforts to cause such direct parent to then dividend or otherwise\n\n        provide such funds to AIG. All contributions and dividends contemplated\n\n        under this Agreement shall be approved, declared and made, as\n\n        applicable, in compliance with applicable law, including, without\n\n        limitation, approval by the board of directors of each applicable entity\n\n        (including the Company) and any prior notice requirements specified\n\n        under applicable rules and regulations of the Domiciliary State.\n\n \n    6. Subject to the requirements of applicable law and the approval, to the\n\n        extent required, by any or all of the Company's senior management,\n\n        relevant management committees, board of directors, and of any insurance\n\n        regulator, the Company hereby acknowledges that, in a manner consistent\n\n        with past practice and\n\n \n       any other reasonable requirements of AIG, it will comply with all\n\n        financial and budgetary planning, risk mitigation, derisking or pricing,\n\n        corporate governance, investment, informational and procedural"
