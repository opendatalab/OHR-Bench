Sponsor wishes to be the exclusive retail store music sponsor of the Excite\n\n      Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages, to distribute its music-related\n\n      content through the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages and to\n\n      promote its online retail music merchandise business to Excite.com users. \nTherefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n \n1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL\n\n\n         a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of\n\n                   the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages.
