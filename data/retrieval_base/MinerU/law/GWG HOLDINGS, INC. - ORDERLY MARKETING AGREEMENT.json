The Seller Trusts further agree that in the event the Bank accepts such role it will be paid customary fees for the performance of its services in connection with such transactions and that such engagement will involve the execution of a standard form agreement with respect to the distribution of each Tranche, which may be in the form of a placement agency agreement, underwriting agreement or other appropriate agreement (each, a “Distribution Agreement”); provided, however, that nothing contained in this OMA or Engagement Letter shall require the Bank to underwrite or purchase all or any portion of a Tranche of Stock for its own account.
