GRANT. Grantor hereby grants to Grantee and Grantee hereby accepts a franchise to construct, reconstruct, operate, maintain, repair, and extend a Gas Distribution System within Grantor’s Territorial Limits in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below (“Franchise”). The Franchise is granted pursuant to Grantor’s Franchise Ordinance (Ordinance No. 967), adopted November 17, 2015, (“Ordinance”), which is incorporated by reference herein, including any applicable definitions. \n2. TERM. The term of the Franchise shall be twenty (20) years, commencing on January 1, 2016. \n# \n(a) Grantee shall pay to Grantor a Franchise Fee which shall be calculated pursuant to this Section. It is understood that Grantee has or will enter into franchise agreements with the City of Roanoke (“Roanoke”) and the City of Salem (“Salem”) and the Town of Vinton (“Vinton”) (Grantor, Roanoke and Salem being hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the “localities” and singularly as a “locality”) with fee provisions identical to this one, and that the total annual Franchise Fee to be paid to the three localities in aggregate is \\$98,196 for calendar year 2016 (“base year total annual Franchise Fee”).

For each calendar year of the Franchise, each locality’s percentage share shall be determined by the following formula: \ntotal dollar value of Grantee’s gas sales within Locality’s percentage share  $=$   the Territorial Limits of the locality total dollar value of Grantee’s gas sales in the three localities \nFor calendar year 2016, the Franchise Fee shall be paid to Grantor on or before March 31, 2017."
