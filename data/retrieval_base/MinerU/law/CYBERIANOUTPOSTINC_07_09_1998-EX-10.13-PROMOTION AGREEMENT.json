(\"CNET\") and Cyberian Outpost, Inc. (the \"Company\"). Pursuant to this Agreement, CNET will provide various links and other online and television promotions (collectively, the \"Promotions\") to the Company to assist the Company in promoting its products and services and facilitating the sale of products to potential buyers through its Internet site. CNET will be compensated by the Company for providing the Promotions. Accordingly, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n\n \n# \n     1.1  The Company. The Company operates an electronic retailing operation\n\n           through its Internet sites located at www.cyberianoutpost.com or\n\n           www.outpost.com (together with any successors to such sites, the\n\n           \"Company Site\"). Through the Company Site, the Company sells or\n\n           facilitates the sale of various products and services, either directly\n\n           or as an agent for third party vendors. All products and services\n\n           offered for sale through the Company Site are referred to as the\n\n           \"Products.\"\n\n \n     1.2  CNET. CNET produces television programs and operates a network of\n\n           Internet sites on the world wide web. For purposes of this Agreement,\n\n           the \"CNET Sites\" refer to any Internet sites operated by CNET or its\n\n           subsidiaries, including without limitation the sites referenced in\n\n           Section 2.5 and Exhibit A.\n\n \n2.   CNET's Obligations.\n\n \n     2.1  TV Promotions. CNET will provide the Company one 15 second \"spot\" for\n\n           Promotions on its syndicated weekly TV program, TV.COM. Promotions\n\n           will run on each weekly episode of TV.COM during the Term; provided\n\n           that TV.COM remains on the air throughout such period. Should TV.COM\n\n           not be run on the air during a portion of the Term, CNET will run two\n\n           download.com banner advertising programs per month during such portion\n\n           of the Term in lieu of the foregoing TV.COM Promotions.\n\n \n     2.2  Banner Promotions. CNET will provide advertising banners to the\n\n           Company during the Term as described in Exhibit A.\n\n \n     2.3  Retail Promotions.\n\n \n          2.3.1  CNET will provide for various retail Promotions across the CNET\n\n                  Sites, which may include text/HTML links, buttons, portals and\n\n                  other fixed Promotions that include embedded links to the\n\n                  Company Site (the \"Retail Promotions\" and, together with the\n\n                  advertising banners contemplated in the preceding paragraph,\n\n                  the \"Online Promotions\").\n\n \n          2.3.2  Subject to Section 4 below, CNET will provide the Company with\n\n                  a total of at least (a) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during\n\n                  the first three months of the Term, (b) [XXXXXX] Retail\n\n                  Impressions during the second three months of the Term, (c)\n\n                  [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during the third three months\n\n                  of the Term, and (d) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during\n\n                  the fourth three months of the Term. For such purposes, a\n\n                  \"Retail Impression\" means the display of one page of a CNET\n\n                  Site that contains at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET fails\n\n                  to provide the Retail Impressions required by the preceding\n\n                  sentence during the Term, then CNET will continue to display\n\n                  Retail Impressions in accordance with this Agreement following\n\n                  the Term (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the\n\n                  Term) until the required number of Retail Impressions has been\n\n                  delivered.\n\n \n     2.4  Placement of Retail Promotions. CNET will determine the location and\n\n           type of each Retail Promotion displayed throughout the CNET Sites and\n\n           may phase in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are developed.\n\n           CNET currently intends to display Retail Promotions consisting of\n\n           text/HTML links, pre-filled with an appropriate query string or link\n\n           (\"Pre-Filled Links\"), as set forth in this Section. The Retail\n\n           Promotions contemplated by this Section will be displayed above the\n\n           fold where the graphical layout of the page reasonably permits such\n\n           positioning (as determined by CNET), and in other cases the Retail\n\n           Promotions will be prominently positioned below the fold. For the\n\n           purposes of clarity, the \"fold\" is defined as the visible portion of\n\n           the screen on a standard 640 x 480 screen size.\n\n \n          2.4.1  On SEARCH.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on the                  search query page related to Shopping and on every search\n\n                  results page served by CNET.\n\n           2.4.2  On CNET.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on pages\n\n                  within the site except the Front Door and except for pages\n\n                  within the Personalities and Community sections.\n\n           2.4.3  On BUILDER.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on\n\n                  pages within the site except the Front Door and the \"Builder\n\n                  Buzz\" section.\n\n           2.4.4  On GAMECENTER.COM, NEWS.COM, DOWNLOAD.COM and SHAREWARE.COM,\n\n                  CNET will display a Pre-Filled Link on pages within the site\n\n                  except the Front Door.\n\n           2.4.5  Other pages of the CNET Sites, CNET will display additional\n\n                  Retail Promotions as appropriate and as mutually agreed upon."

In particular, the\n\n           Company agrees that the Company Site will comply with the performance\n\n           standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the Term. Any failure by\n\n           the Company to comply with this paragraph will be deemed to be a\n\n           material breach of this Agreement.\n\n \n     3.2  Reporting.

The\n\n           \"CNET Sales\" will be counted as sales by the Company to each User who\n\n           accesses the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for\n\n           a period of 4 hours from the referral, CNET and The Company will agree\n\n           on technical procedures to allow the easy and accurate reporting of\n\n           CNET Sales.

Payments\n\n                  under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by\n\n                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such\n\n                  reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within\n\n                  30 days after the end of each month of the Term.\n\n \n          3.3.2  Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by wire transfer\n\n                  of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once paid.\n\n \n     3.4  User Information. At least once each calendar quarter, the Company\n\n           will deliver to CNET all aggregate data collected as a result of the\n\n           CNET Sales, including but not limited to, demographic data, buying\n\n           behavior as measured by conversion to sale, frequency of purchasing,\n\n           average order size, and a comparison to the respective average for the\n\n           Company.\n\n \n     3.5  Reciprocal Marketing.

Nothing contained in this Agreement will give CNET any right,\n\n           title or interest in or to the Company Marks or the goodwill\n\n           associated therewith, except for the limited usage rights expressly\n\n           provided above. CNET acknowledges and agrees that, as between the\n\n           Company and CNET, the Company is the sole owner of all rights in and\n\n           to the Company Marks.\n\n \n     6.2  The Company hereby represents and warrants to CNET that the Company\n\n           has, and will have throughout the Term, all necessary rights in and to\n\n           the Company Marks to grant CNET the licenses and usage rights\n\n           contemplated by this Agreement without violating the rights of any\n\n           third party.\n\n \n7.
