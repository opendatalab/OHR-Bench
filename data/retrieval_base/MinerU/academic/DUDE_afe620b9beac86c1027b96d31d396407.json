        "text": "# \nYour Directors have pleasure in submitting their Annual Report and Accounts of the Company for the year ended 31st March 2003. \n# \nAgainst a forecast GDP growth of $6.7\\%$ , India achieved a GDP growth of $4.3\\%$ . In the first two quarters the growth was $5.3\\%$ and $5.2\\%$ . The growth slowed dramatically in the third quarter due to the poor monsoon. The rate recovered in the fourth quarter to $4.9\\%$ as reported by the National Council of Applied Economic Research. \nAgricultural growth as a consequence of the drought recorded one of the sharpest declines over the last 20 years of $3.2\\%$ . Industry recovered in 2002-03 and recorded an overall growth of $5.7\\%$ , with manufacturing marginally better at $6\\%$ . The capital goods and consumer non-durables sectors showed growth of $10.6\\%$ and $11.9\\%$ respectively. Indian exports grew in all major categories despite the strengthening rupee against the US dollar. \nIn summary, the Indian economy did reasonably well despite the drought and the uncertainty in global demand due to the Middle East situation and SARS. \nDespite this, future growth depends on a growing agricultural sector. Over $70\\%$ of India's population reside in rural India. Growth in the rural economy is necessary for price stability as well as the profitability of the manufacturing sector. It is, therefore, essential to commit and implement a package of reforms in the agriculture sector, along with necessary investments in rural infrastructure. \n# \nHeavily regulated environment \nWhile the overall manufacturing industry is witnessing a reasonable growth of $6\\%$ , the domestic cigarette industry operates in an ever increasing regulatory environment that effectively subsidises the non-cigarette tobacco products at the cost of cigarettes. The significant aspect of this regulation is two fold: firstly, discriminatory taxation and secondly, discriminatory advertising and marketing restrictions. \nTaxation \nWhile cigarettes account for approximately $14\\%$ of total tobacco consumption, they account for $85\\%$ of total tobacco excise tax revenues. In addition, the cigarette industry is also liable to pay state taxes such as luxury and entry taxes, etc. which equate to approximately $10\\%$ of the excise tax. The impact of this effective subsidised taxation on the non-cigarette tobacco products has seen India's consumption of cigarette per capita sinking below Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal to one of the lowest in the world. As a consequence, consumption on non-cigarette tobacco products including bidis and chewing tobacco has grown to be the highest in the world!"

        "text": "Clearly the tax policy of placing the majority of the excise burden on cigarettes has not achieved its stated social objective of decreasing tobacco consumption, nor has the Government been able to optimize the revenue collected as a result of the declining tax base. With globalisation of the Indian market, discriminatory taxation will result in an increasing percentage of the tobacco market going to illegal imports. Not only will the taxation policy not dissuade consumption, it will merely downgrade it to non- cigarette products and lead to a loss of tax revenue to the \ngovernment, loss of tobacco farm income and cigarette manufacturing income and diminish export potential. \n\n\nThe significance of the impact of the taxation policy on Indian cigarettes is best illustrated when we compare our closest neighbour China and look at its cigarette tax and total tax collection (see the table below): \n# \nbase must be established for all tobacco products, reducing the discriminatory gap between cigarette and non-cigarette tobacco products. The tax base should have no or, at best, moderate increases if the government hopes to achieve its stated social objective and not lose excise revenue to cheap and/or illegal imports. \n# \nThe recent introduction of the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products .. Act, 2003 imposing advertising bans, product labeling and other restrictions only on domestic tobacco, further discriminates domestic cigarette brands against imported products. Advertising \nand promotion of imported brands is seen on cable television in India allowing promotion of their products over domestic cigarette brands. \n\nThe Act's ban on tobacco sales within 100 yards of educational institutions will cause significant dislocation in the retail and farming sector and result in loss of income given the density of population in India. Of greater concern, it will encourage illegal sales in these areas. \nBoth the discriminatory taxation and marketing regulations imposed on the domestic cigarette industry will further erode the value of the domestic industry, reduce the government taxation base by encouraging cheaper foreign brands or contraband, reduce tobacco farm income, as more products are supplied from overseas, adding to unemployment. All this without reducing overalltobacco consumption. \n# \nAlternatively, the tobacco industry in India could move from the second largest producer of tobacco to become the worlds largest exporter of tobacco, generating substantial export revenue, quantum increases in farm income and significant employment. This requires a commitment to growing better quality tobacco at higher yields (export quality) as is used in the production of cigarettes, moving away from leaf used in non-cigarette production. This initiative can only be undertaken by the domestic industry if there is a clear government commitment to export growth with the associated more equitable taxation systems allowing the improvement in income to invest in the structural change necessary to achieve this solution. \nThe graph below shows that a 7-fold increase in export earning can be achieved by obtaining just a $5\\%$ share in the world tobacco trade. Continued discrimination against the domestic cigarette industry will result in whateve little share of world tobacco export trade India has $(0.7\\%)$ moving to our more competitive neighbours,including China."

        "text": "Our vision is to become a leading tobacco player in India and beyond with a global mindset and the Company stands ready to work with the government to achieve the solution outlined above. \n# \n# \nIncrease export earning 7 times with just $5\\%$ shareof the global tabacco trade \nSource: The Tobacco Institute of India \nThe Company undertook a number of developmental activities in different tobacco areas to help uplift the farming community by transferring latest farm technology to achieve higher yield per hectare and better produce, enabling them to realise better prices and earnings per hectare. We also helped them introduce an Integrated Pest Management System and supply of pheromone traps, nuclear polyhydro virus solution and neem products to reduce the pesticide residue in tobacco production. We also did trials on production of flavourful tobacco to help farmers produce more exportable tobaccos and realise better profits, with \nvery promising results. These efforts have been duly recognised by Government scientists and Tobacco Board Officials. \n# \nNot unaccustomed to working in difficult environments, your Company has managed to launch three new brands and grow our market share of the domestic cigarette industry to over $11\\%$ .This is a $10+\\%$ increase on 2001-02 and was undertaken at a time when the industry had only marginal growth. \nThis year saw the most significant investmentin new and existing brands, including the launch ofPiper, Tipper and Prince. Both Piper and Tipper involved new innovations in the Indian market, with Tipper's technology being copied by competitors. Prince was launched in a totally revamped version with improved smoke as well as packaging. New campaigns were undertaken for Four Square and Cavanders brands. \nThe Company also launched three cigar brands, Phillies, Hav-a-tampa and Don Diego in the domestic market in 2002. These cigars are imported by the Company under an arrangement with Altadis of USA, one of the World's leading cigar manufacturers. \nTo ensure that these new brands and your Company's existing brands are well presented and accessible to customers, investments have been made in the sales and distribution system resulting in significant increase in retail servicing and brand presence. At the same time, we are investing in building stronger relationships with ourtrade partners. \nA major investment was made in R & D facilities at the Mumbai factory to establish a state-of-the-art facility. Further investments were made in upgrading both the manufacturing facilities. Continued training and the application of the “Kaizen Teian\" scheme have again resulted in improvement in overall operating efficiencies and reduction in manufacturing costs. In recognition of these efforts, the Company won the highest award from INSAAN for the sixth successive year. \n# \nThe global over supply of tea led to bearish trends in commodity prices for the fourth successive year. These depressed market conditions led to a $9\\%$ decline in the domestic packet tea market resulting in its further fragmentation. \nTo meet these challenges,the Tea business was restructured and overheads reduced. The Company focused on markets which satisfied contribution and profitability objectives, while exiting unviable territories. As a result of this the business achieved positive cash flows by the second half of the financial year. Total segment revenues were Rs. 31 crore for the year. \nGood progress was made with opportunities identified in the high value, growth segment of out-of-home beverages. Test marketing of innovative ways of addressing this market are planned during the current financial year. \nDuring the first quarter of the current year your Company has achieved sales of Rs.6.3 crore against Rs. 7.2 crore in the corresponding period last year. The sales decline is mainly due to exiting low profitability areas in the domestic market and lower exports. Domestic marginal contribution has been increased by around $2\\%$ overthecorresponding period."

        "text": "During the year the FOB value of the export of the Company including tobacco, cigarettes and tea were significantly higher at Rs. 52.47 crore as against Rs. 10.99 crore in the previous year. The cigarette exports increased from Rs. 2.4 crore in the previous year to Rs. 19.2 crore during the year under report. During the first four months of the current year the Company has exported cigarettes worth Rs. 11 crore. \n# \nDuring the year under report the cigarettes sales volume rose to 10593 million cigarettes as against 8854 million cigarettes in the previous year, recording an increase of $19.64\\%$ . The sales turnover was also higher at Rs. 1077 crore as against Rs. 945 crore in the previous year, registering an increase of $14\\%$ . The Company continued to make major investments in improving the equity of its existing brands in a highly competitive environment. The focus on development of innovative products and investments made therein have helped the Company in introduction oftwo unique products for the first time in the Industry under the brand names Piper and Tipper. The latter has become an instant success and a trendsetter in the Industry. All these efforts have helped the Company improve its overall performance. In June 2003, your Company launched yet another brand, Jaisalmer, in the North in the premium king size segment. \nThe profit before taxation and exceptional item was higher at Rs. 79.60 crore as against Rs. 71.84 crore in the previous year. However, after providing for the taxation and after considering exceptional expense on account of Assam dues becoming doubtful of recovery due to the retrospective amendment made in the Finance Act 2003, as further explained hereunder, the net profit of the Company was lower at Rs. 37.91 crore as against Rs. 47.80 crore in the previous year. \n# \nKeeping in view the overall performance and optimistic outlook for the future, the Board of Directors of the Company are pleased to recommend a dividend of Rs. 17 per share which, together with dividend tax, works out to Rs. 19.20 per share as against Rs. 18.50 per share paid out in the previous year. This is despite the lower net profit for the year due to provision for a substantial amount on account of an exceptional item. \n# \n\n\\begin{tabular}{lll}\nFINANCIAL RESULTS & 2002-2003 Rs. in lac & 2001-2002 Rs. in lac \\\\\nGross Profit Less : Depreciation Provision forTaxation-current -deferred & 8873.49 913.01 2918.00 (1018.22) & 7995.12 811.28 2466.00 (61.71) \\\\\nProfit after tax for the year Exceptional item (Refer note 15 to accounts) & 6060.70 2270.09 & 4779.55 \\\\\nProfit Brought Forward & 3790.61 16233.07 & 4779.55 14377.30 \\\\\nAppropriations & 20023.68 & 19156.85 \\\\\nProposed Dividend Corporate Dividend Tax & 1767.80 & 1923.78 \\\\\nTransfer to General Reserve Surplus carried to Balance Sheet & 226.50 1100.00 16929.38 20023.68 & 1000.00 16233.07 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\nAs stated in earlier years, the Company entered into contracts in March 2000 with some manufacturing units in Assam for purchase of certain quantities of cigarettes at economical prices, on account of these units enjoying exemption from payment of excise duty in pursuance of an exemption notification issued by the Central Government earlier. The Government withdrew the exemption in January 2001 and, thereafter, these units closed down operations. However, there was a net outstanding amount ofRs. 22.70 crore recoverable as on 31 March, 2003 from these units against the amount of advances given to them by the Company from time to time for making deposits with excise authorities, which under the said arrangements, they were to return to the Company on receipt of the refund of such deposits from the excise department. The Government has, however, withheld some of the refunds of excise duty due to such units pursuant to the said exemption notification. \nThe said manufacturing units had moved the Guwahati High Court against the unfair and illegal action on the part of the excise department. The Court passed an order on 17 May, 2002 directing the excise department to grant refunds to these units. The excise department had then moved the appellate bench of the High Court by way of an appeal. The Division Bench of Guwahati High Court dismissed the appeal of the central excise department on4 April, 2003 and directed the department to refund the amounts within 30 days of the judgement. However, the Finance Bill, 2003 proposed a retrospective amendmenttothe Notification, which sought to provide forthe denial of refunds in terms of the Notification from the date of its issue, i.e. 8 July, 1999. Consequently,the refunds earlier granted to the Assam Units were also to be refunded back to the Government within 30 days of the passing of the Finance Bill, which became an Act after passage by the Parliament and assent by the President on 14 May, 2003. \nNotwithstanding the directions of the Division Bench of the Guwahati High Court, armed with the provisions contained in the Finance Act 2003, the department initiated action by issue of orders for recovery of the past refunds from the Assam Units and rejected all the pending claims. The Assam Units, therefore, sought the protection of the Guwahati High Court by moving a Writ Petition challenging the provisions of the Finance Act as being bad in law."

The said stay is now listed for final hearing on 17th September, 2003. \nBased on the legal opinion received from eminent counsels, your Directors feel confident that the benefit of the Notification cannot be legally denied consequent upon amendment thereto by the Finance Act, 2003. However, as a measure of prudence the said amounts aggregating to Rs. 22.70 crore recoverable from the said units have been provided for in these accounts. \n# \nYour Company has an adequate system of internal control commensurate with the size of the Company and the nature of its business which ensures that transactions are recorded, authorised and reported correctly apart from safeguarding its assets against loss from wastage, unauthorised use and disposition. \nThe internal control system is supplemented by well documented policies, guidelines and procedures, an extensive programme of internal audit by a firm of chartered accountants and management reviews. \n# \nThe Human Resources Department has continued the work of implementing the necessary changes to bring company systems in line with the top FMCG companies in India.
