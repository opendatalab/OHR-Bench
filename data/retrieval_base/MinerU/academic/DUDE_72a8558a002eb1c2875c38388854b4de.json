        "text": "During the preparation of this Memoir on the Shell Mounds of Omori, I have examined, in company withi othcrs whose names are mentioned below, deposits of a similar nature at Otaru, on the western Coast of Yezo, HIakodate, a number within the city limits of Tokio, and one of enormous extcnt and depth in the Province of Higo, Island of Kinshiu. \nFrom all these places large collections have been made, and are now in tlie Archeological Museum of the University of Tokio. \nAs the Omori Mounds have proved so rich in material, it was thought best to limit this frst contribntion to an exhaustive illustration of the various forms and ornamentations there occurring, tlus making it the basis for future comparisons when thie other deposits shall have been worked up. In Yamagata Ken, for example, as well as in the Tokio Deposits, fragments of pottery are met with, bearing so close a rescmblance to the Omori forms that a reference to them may be made without fmrther illustratiou, while only new forms need be figured and dlescribed. For these reasons, the attcmpt has been made to figure every typical form  of shape and ornamentation. In nany cases, also, the varietal modifeation in shape and design has been given, as with the rims on Plate VIII. and the knobs on Plates XI. and XII. \nIt may be stated that many of the other forms figured, are represented by a number of varieties vhich are contained in the Museum of the University. \nProfessional duties at the University, connected with instruction and the arranging of the Museum, prevented my giving that supervision over the plates necessary to secure the uniformity which they lack,  When it is considered however, that the drawing (witlh the exception of the last plate) and lithographing have been done entirely by Japanese artists,—-the art of drawing in foreig style, and the art of lithography being still new to them,some allowances may be made for the inperfeetions they present. \nOn the other hand, it may be said with truth that all the outlines are correct, and that full reliance may be placed on the fgures.  The same excuse may be made with reference to the composition and press work, as these labors have been done in a Japanese office, the compositors not being able to speak a word of English. With some pride, it may be said that the paper on which the book has been printed is of Japanese manufacture, so that froni composition to binding, the mechanical prodnction is entirely Japanese.  As a Japanese version has been issued, the plates have been lettered fcr that edition also."

        "text": "# \nBY EDWARD S. MORSE. \nSince the appearance of Darwin's great work on the Origin of Species, and the subsequent revolutiou in the minds of thinking men regarding the origin of man and animals belov him, a new impulse has been given to the investigations of man's early history ; a new science, in fact, has sprang into activity, and Societies. and Journals of Anthropology, Archeology and Ethnology are the results of this wonderfnl awakening. \nWitlhi the idea so long dominant that man had been specially created at a certain tine to be measured by years, only those documents and those evidences were scamned whiclh came within the prescribed time limits. Thirty years ago it seemed as useless a task to study the evidences of man's cxistence before these dates, as it wonld be for one to stndy the evidences of the Spanish occupation of America before the year I492. \nIn fact so apathetic were men's minds on this matter, or rather so thronghly was incorporated the idea of man's recent origin, that many valuable evidences have been neglected, or lost through this lamentable condition of things. Observations on the high antiquity of man made by Dr. Schmerling, Mr. Mac Eaery, Mr. Godwin Austen and others attracted but little attention. Indeed they were received withn incredulity, and tlhe memoir of Mr. Vivian read before the Geological Society was considered too improbable for publication.\\*Yet the labors and discoveries of tliese men have been repeatedlly confirmed by subsequent investigations. \nDifficult indeed is it to restore the past history of mankind from the fragmentary remains found buried in the earth. Their life history must be made up entirely fronn the impcrishable objects which have been preserved in caves, burial places, the refuse piles of their villages, and similar places. Theyleftno written record, no hieroglyphics to decipler, because they had none."

        "text": "It seems at first sight impossible to bnill up any idea of their habits and comparative states of savagery from the few ohjects wlhich have survived the corroding'influences of time. \nWere we to apply the same miethods to the study of civilized races to day, very little could be gathered of our life by an exainination of the refuse piles of our dwellings. All the delicate works of art, wood carving, embroidery, books, models, ete. would disappear in the time that lias elapsed since the earlier ages of man, and we sliould only have left tlie glass, porcelain, and stone fragments which would survive. From the refinement and delicacy of these objects, liowever, we would have a right to infer the progress and condition of the race, and would be, justified in the assumption tlhat in their perishable art the same refinement had bcen manifested. \nIt is trne these deposits do not give us their textile fabrics, if they had any, or their wood work or more perishable art ; but judging the ancient savage by the modern one, tle sites of their villages, or contents of their refuse heaps, give us a very fair indication of what they possessed.  The imprint of matting or. cloth upon their pottery tells us at once the texture and kind of fabric nsed. An arrow liead presupposes a wooden shaft. Knowing liow scantily supplied with objects the hut of a low savage is to day, we have every reason to believe that the primitive savage was no bettcr providled in tliese respects. \nThe importance of studlying deposits of the nature of the Omori Mounds has been fnlly realized, since the investigations of the Danish shell mounds brought to light so many facts bearing on the habits of the primitive races of Denmark. Of such importance was an examination of the Danish deposits considered, that the Government appointed a commission eonsisting of three men highly eminent in sciencc to make exhaustive explorations. And now so jealously does she guard lher treasnures that laws havc been enacted prolibiting the exportation of archeological specimens or antiqnities of any kind from the country. With the existence of an Archacological Society in Tokio, consisting exclusively of Japanese,. who hold their meetings regularly, and the fact that tliere have already been a number of works pnblished by nativc archeologists who lhave figured with more or less accuracy the stone implements, ancient vesseis, inscriptions and the liket it seems proper and jnst that Government should follow the example of Greece, Italy and Denmark in passing laws to prevent tlhcse treasnres from going ou, of the conntry. May thc Giovernment not only prevent the expoitation of specimens, but may it jcalously guard its ancient tcmples, monuments, gate ways and idols. I can not refrain from quoting at this point the words of an accom-- plished English archacologist, Mr. Borlase, who expresses a hope “\"that the liberal views wlhich liave hitherto prompted thie Mikado's Government in all that relatcs to science and art, may be extended to that chef d'eurre of their country ( wlhich is indeed unmatched in the world ) and that authors may yet have to record the gracefnl act, on the part of the present Administration, whicli has saved from destruetion tlie most beautiful relic of ‘ Old Japan ′ the tombs of theShoguns.'"

        "text": "Besides the investigations of Steenstrup in Denmark, we have the valuable memoirs of Wyman on the shell mounds of Florida and New England.  Deposits of a sinmilar nature have been recorded or deseribed as ocurring in England, Seotland, Ireland, France, the Eastern coast of the United States, the valley of the Mississippi, on tlie west coast from California to. Behring Strait, Brazil, the Gulf of Guayaqnil, Australia, Tasmania, and the Malay Archipelago ; and doubtless they vill be found scattered all over the world. \nThat these deposits are not all of tlhe sane age is certain ; for just as the stone age exists in certain parts of the world to-day, so these deposits are in proeess of formation botlh among savage and civilized people. IVhile the slhell heaps of New England liave tle same essential features as those of Denmark, it can not be safely assumed thiey were made long before tlie advent of the LEnropean1 ; for the natives were then living in the stone age, as it were, and were stillforming deposits of shell in precisely the same way.  It is true tlhat many of these deposits when first observed by the earliest settlers were covered with a lieavy growth of forest trees, and the presence of a moiar tootli of the polar bear, and the abundance of the remains of the great auk now supposed to be extinct, leal us to believe that tlie New England deposits lave some antiquity. \nIn Japan, licwever, the case is quite different ; for witlh its ancient civilization and history, running back for ffteen hundred and perhaps two tliousand years, and the fidelity of its records, ve have as it were a louger time measurement by which to estimate the age of the shell deposits liere.  For this reason a muclh greater importance attaches to the miuute and faithful exploration of sucll deposits in Japan. \nHaving for years studied these deposits in Maine and Massachusetts in com. pany witli Prof. Jefries IWyman and Prof. F. W. Putnam, I felt prepared to undertake a sinilar investigation in tlhis country and therefore at the outset kept a shiarp look out for evidences of their occurrence. A few dlays after my arrival in the country I fortmately liscovered a large and extensive shiell mound on the immediate line of the railway a few miles from Tokio. A series of explorations was made in conpany witli ny special stndents, Mr. Matsura and Mr. Sasaki, and, in the frst excavations Prof. Yatabe, Prof. Toyama, Mr. Matsumura, Mr. Fukuyo, Dr. David Murray, and Prof. Parson participated. The collections from Onori are now arranged in tlie Archeologieal Museum of the Tokio Daigaku.

        "text": "The Omiori Shell Momds lie on the western side of tlhe Imperial railway between Yokoliama aud Tokio, at a distance of nearly six miles from Tokio. They may be seen from tlie car windows just after leaving Omori Station in going toward Tokio. \nThe railway has indeedl passed througli a large portion of the mounds, as in the field beyond the track the ground is strewn with the fragmenits of pottery and the shells forincrly composing the deposit.  Thc length of the deposit along the embankment is about eightynine meteis. Its (lepth in the thickest part is fonr meters. Another exposure of considerable thickness is seeu, back from the track at a distance of ninetyfive meters, but whether it is a contiunation of the first leposit I have not been able to determine. \nThe ficlds to the south show that in their cultivation another deposit has been removed. \nThe mounds are nearly half a mile fronn the shores of the Bay of Yedo. \nAs deposits of this nature are always made along the immediate shore, whether thiey be upon the bauks of a river, or on the coast, the occurrence of these deposits iuland may be looked upon as an evidence that the land lhas been elevated since they were made.  And wlen they ocur inland, geological, and often historical evideuces are not wanting to support this view. \nThe shel mounds along the Baltic are in inany cases far removed from the coast line. They also contain species of shells not found in the Baltic, in consequence of the fresliening of tlha water resulting from the geological changes that have taken place in that water basin. \nAlong the eastern coast of the United States, thie ocean has been encroaching upon the land, and shell mounds in Casco Bay, Maine, are in process of being washed away by the waves. \nIRev. Jaunes Fowler, in the Smithsonian Report for ls70, coniments upon the absence of these deposits along the New Brunswick coast, and offers this as one of the evilences that the sea is encroaching upon the land, and calls attention to the fact that bnildings which stood at some distance from the shore, ffty years ago, have since been washed away.. \nGeological evidenccs show that marked changes have takeu place in the slhore line of the Bay of Yedo. A portion of these changes are recorded historically on ancient maps of Yedo. \nShell mounls discovered by Mr. Kanda and Prof. Yatabe iu the Botanical Garden, aud others discorered by Prof. Chaplin and Mr. Ishikawa in Oji, show a recedencc of thic waters of the Bay of Yedo of from five to seven miles. \nIn every case these mounds are oun ground slightly elevated above the sur rounding country, and in indicating tlieir various positions on a map of Tokio, the coincilence between the sliadled line of an embankment, andl the position of the deposit is at once seen."

        "text": "SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OMIORI 1EI'OSIT'S \nThe sliell moundls, or deposits, in various parts of the world have many featuresin common. They also lave tlheir distinguishing peculiarities. Their similarity arises from the fact tlhat they are the refuse piles of savage races who came to the shore at certain times of the year, or who occupied the shore permanently and there availed themselves of the food so easily secured from tlie water,in the sliape of mollusks and fislies. Tliat they were hunters as well as fishermen is attested by the presence of the bones of wild animals, sucli as the dlecr, bear, and wild boar, as well as the bones of certaiu birds.  Tlhe bones bcing in nearly every case broken into fragments, show tlhat they did tlhis to secnre the marrow, or to more conveniently get them into tlheir cooking pots. Thiattheycookedl their food in clay vessels, is evident from the carbonized remains of the food foundl on certain fragments of pottery.  In all tliese deposits various primitive implements are found, fabricated out of either bone, horn, stone or sliell. \nThe horu, bone and shell implements are generally in the sliape of. gouges, bodkins, needlles and other pointed instruments. The stone implements are usually of the rudest kind, and consist of hanmers, celts, axes, arrows, and spear points. The pottery is rude, and in all parts of the worldl bears the impression of tlhe well known cord mark. Beside this ornamentation, if indeed it was iutended for tliat purpose, there are often rudle designs, (rarely, if ever imitative of natural objects) made by incised lines in the soft clay, or impressed upon the clay by stamps. While tliese features are common in dleposits of tlhis nature, even in thiose most videly removedl, the deposits of each country and region seem to have tleir distinguislhing peculiarities, so that one familiar witlh the dleseription of them might tell witli considerable aecuracy tlie place of eacli deposit by an examination of a mass of material from it. The Danish deposits contain a great many fint chips and rude fint implemeuts. Tlie pottery loes not appear to be common, and is of the simplest description. No evidences of cannibalism have been noticed. The New England deposits resemble greatly the Danish deposits in the character of the animal remaius. The stone implements are very mucln fewer lhowever, and tlie pottery is not common. \nSimple liorn and bone implements occur in both.  In the New England deposits, Prof. Wyman found a few evidences of canmibalism. In the Florida. moundls, as studied by Prof. Wyman, tlie pottery is again very rude, and besides the cord mark and incised lines, presents an ornamentation producedl by stamps witli defuite designs upon them. Runle arrow lheads and spear points were niet with, and more rarely bone implements. These are made fron the bones of the deer, and Vyman observes that the bones are broke:, rather thian split, as is the case witli tlie old world deposits. Besidle tlhe stamped pottery, anotler marked peculiarity cf the Florida mounds consists in the presenee of gouges, chisels and other impiements worked out of shell, generally the eolumella or axis of tlhe large Strombus aad Faseiolaria being used. Widely distributed evidenees of cannibalism also occur."
